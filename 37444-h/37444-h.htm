<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>This book has been prepared with the special
purpose of assisting mothers throughout the
country to train their small daughters in the art
of cookery. Scarcely any child can be trusted
to take a recipe and work alone, as the clearest
directions need the watchful supervision of an experienced
woman, who can detect the coming mistake
and explain the reason for doing things in
a certain way.</p>

<p>All children like to experiment in the kitchen,
and instead of allowing them to become an annoyance,
they should be so directed that their efforts
will result in immediate help to the mother
and prove invaluable life lessons to the little ones
themselves. Nothing is really more pitiable than
the helpless woman who, when occasion demands,
finds herself unable to do ordinary cooking. And
that young wife is blessed indeed who has been
prepared for her duties in the home by a conscientious
mother. Therefore let no woman think
it too much trouble to teach her child the preparation
of various kinds of food, impressing on her
at the same time the dignity and importance of
the work.</p>

<p>The following articles, though considerably
lengthened and rearranged, were written at the
request of the Editor, and ran for a year in <i>Pictorial
Review</i>; and the encouraging letters they
elicited from women and children everywhere,
prompted this publication in book form. The intention
has been not to make a complete manual
of cookery, but instead to create interest in enough
branches to enable an otherwise inexperienced
person to successfully put together any good
recipe. Thanks are also due for the use of material
appearing in <i>The Circle</i> and <i>Harper's
Bazar</i>.</p>

<h2>COOKERY FOR LITTLE<br />
GIRLS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Good Things For Breakfast</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(For these recipes, unless otherwise specified, make all
measurements level. The use of measuring cups, divided
into halves and thirds, is strongly urged, as well as the tea
and table measuring spoons.)</p></div>

<p>Every mother should begin to instruct her little
daughter at an early age in the different
branches of housekeeping, and if taught in the
right way, none will prove more attractive than
cooking. When quite young the child will be
eager to experiment, and generally will be careful;
and with many of the simple recipes she can
scarcely make a mistake, and they will prove invaluable
to her later on.</p>

<p>Cooking is of great educational value. Aside
from giving a girl that knowledge necessary to
the proper conduct of a home, in the dextrous
handling of utensils and food products, the concentration
required, and the practice of doing certain
work for certain results, it also gives excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
mental training and brings all-round development.
Every girl should become a good
practical cook; and in the majority of cases the
mother, for many reasons, is the best teacher.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>EQUIPMENT</b></div>

<p>The small cook should be provided with her
own apron, sleeves and cap. Also attach to her
belt a tea-towel and a small holder for lifting hot
pans. This will make her feel more important and
too, impress upon her the need of having everything
clean and orderly. Then emphasize the necessity
of always following directions, and taking
the pains to make each cupful an <i>even</i> cupful&mdash;each
spoonful an <i>even</i> spoonful. The pan for
baking should be thoroughly greased and set aside
ready for use, after the fire has first been put in
good condition, so that the oven will be right, and
then all the cooking utensils and materials placed
conveniently at hand.</p>

<p>For the first lesson suppose the choice be baking-powder
biscuit. When properly made they
are delicious, but from the number of times that
otherwise good cooks fail on this point, I have
come to the conclusion that the secret lies in the
mixing and handling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img014.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="Preparing to Make Biscuit" title="" />
<span class="caption">Preparing to Make Biscuit</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT</b></div>

<p>Have the child place two even cupfuls of flour
in the sifter, with two level teaspoonfuls of baking-powder,
half a teaspoonful of salt, and then
sift. To this add one rounded tablespoonful of
lard. The little maid's hands and nails should be
specially cleaned so she can work this thoroughly
into the flour, and it may take her five minutes to
do it properly. Next, dusting her hands, have
her take a table fork and stir all the time as she
adds the milk. Generally three-quarters of a cupful
of milk is enough, but if the flour was packed
in solid it may take a whole cupful. Mix up well
with the fork into a soft dough, and turn out on
a floured bread-board. She must not handle it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
even now, but sprinkle over just enough flour to
keep the rolling-pin from sticking while she rolls
it out until three-fourths of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Next she should be shown how to cut into small
rounds without any waste, for the dough that is
left to be molded over will take up more flour and
consequently be thicker and not so light. As each
biscuit is cut it should be carefully placed in the
pan, close to its neighbor, but not crowding, and
when all are ready, popped into a hot oven for fifteen
minutes' baking.</p>

<p>This lesson should be repeated in a few days,
before the child has forgotten any of the details,
and thereafter it is advisable to let her make the
same dough, for different purposes, at least once
a week for a while. For meat pies, dumplings, or
shortcake, one-half the recipe will be plenty for a
family of four, and she will feel that she has
learned each time how to make a new dish. Provide
a small blank book and have her write down
every recipe, with the full directions for mixing.
This will be her very own, and as it grows will
come to be a valued treasure.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BAKED APPLES</b></div>

<p>As cooked fruits are such nourishing food, let
the child prepare some kind while the biscuits are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
baking&mdash;apples, for instance. The oven being
hot, it is best to bake them, so show her how to
wash, core and then fill each opening with sugar,
cinnamon and a little butter. It will take only
a few moments to prepare them, and while the
baking is in progress the dishes that have been
used should be washed and set in the closet, the
materials left be put away. All must be in order
before the lesson is pronounced over and the dish-pan
wiped and put up. Where it is desired to
serve the apples and biscuits at the same meal,
the apples should be prepared first, as they take
longer to bake.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CORN BREAD</b></div>

<p>Corn bread, too, is easy for any child to make.
Have her mix one and one-half cups of sifted
flour, one-half cup of yellow corn meal, three tablespoons
of granulated sugar, one teaspoon of
salt and two teaspoons of baking powder. Add
two well-beaten eggs, one cup milk, and one tablespoon
of melted butter. Pour in buttered tin or
gem pans, and bake in hot oven for fifteen or
twenty minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MUFFINS</b></div>

<p>Then next try muffins. Have her sift two cups
of flour, one teaspoon of salt, and two teaspoons
of baking powder. Add one cup of milk, two tablespoons
of melted butter, and two eggs, with
the stiff whites last. Bake in buttered muffin
tins fifteen or twenty minutes in a hot oven.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GRIDDLE CAKES</b></div>

<p>If successful with these things, she will be quite
sure with a little care to make good griddle cakes.
Have her sift two cups of flour with two teaspoons
of baking powder, half a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon
of sugar, and stir in the yolks of two
eggs, well beaten, and a cup and a half of milk.
When perfectly smooth, and just before baking,
fold in the stiff whites. Grease a hot griddle with
a piece of suet, put down a spoonful of batter at
a time, and turn as soon as it bubbles well over
the top. Watch carefully to keep from burning,
but never turn a pancake the second time.</p>

<p>After a girl has learned how to make biscuit
and other light breads, she should be shown at
once how to prepare eggs in different ways so that
she will be able at any time to serve a dainty
breakfast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Creamed Eggs on Toast</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BOILED EGGS</b></div>

<p>To boil an egg would seem to be the easiest
matter possible, but it requires care just the same.
Scarcely any two people in a family like eggs
cooked the same length of time, and so, after
ascertaining the way each one prefers, have the
water boiling hard, and then check by adding a
little cold water so that the shells will not crack
from the heat. Put in the eggs carefully with a
tablespoon, to prevent striking each other, boil
the required number of minutes and remove each
when its time is up, sending to the table at once.
Hard boiled eggs, to be digestible, should be kept
just at the boiling point for thirty minutes. The
yolks will then be mealy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>POACHED EGGS</b></div>

<p>Poached eggs should be dropped in buttered gem
pans and then set in a deep dripping-pan and
covered with boiling water. When boiled as long
as desired, lift gently on to rounds of buttered
toast, sprinkle with salt and pepper, garnish with
parsley or small celery leaves and serve on a hot
platter.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PLAIN OMELET</b></div>

<p>For an omelet for four people, separate yolks
and whites of five eggs. Beat yolks very light,
add one-quarter teaspoonful salt, pepper, five tablespoonfuls
milk, and lastly the whites, beaten
very stiff. Mix lightly, but thoroughly, and pour
in well-buttered hot frying-pan, place on stove
about two minutes until well puffed up, then put
in oven for a moment until firm on top. On removing,
fold omelet over with a cake-turner, place
on a hot plate and garnish with parsley.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FANCY OMELETS</b></div>

<p>After the little daughter has mastered this popular
dish, show her how to make it into a fancy
one by adding various things. A small quantity
(half a cupful) of chopped ham stirred in before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
cooking, converts it into a ham omelet, a cupful
of cold boiled rice mixed thoroughly through the
uncooked eggs, a rice omelet, while a cupful of
chopped meat&mdash;or better, chopped chicken&mdash;will
make a meat or chicken omelet. A delicious green
corn omelet has the pulp from two ears of green
corn, grated from the cob, added just before
cooking. This should be given a slower fire and
more time. For a cheese omelet, sprinkle half a
cupful of grated cheese over the eggs after they
are cooked before folding over.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>OMELET GARNISHING</b></div>

<p>The wise mother will suggest to the young cook
that instead of always using one recipe she try to
think of some way of improving or varying it.
A few green peas left from dinner can be made
hot and sprinkled over an omelet the same way
as the cheese, or the cup of stewed tomatoes
left from the day before be strained, thickened
with a teaspoonful of flour, seasoned with butter,
pepper and salt, and served as a sauce, this making
a delicious accompaniment to a plain omelet.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAMED EGGS</b></div>

<p>Take the desired number of hot hard-boiled
eggs, cut in quarters, lay on pieces of hot buttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
toast, and cover with white sauce. This
makes a most appetizing dish for breakfast or
luncheon. Garnish with parsley.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DEVILLED EGGS</b></div>

<p>Put on in hot water, simmer for half an hour,
then place in cold water to loosen shells. When
cold, cut in half, remove yolks, mash, and season
with salt, pepper, a dash of prepared mustard,
and a teaspoonful of vinegar, with a half teaspoonful
of soft butter for each egg. Rub to a
smooth paste, and pack back in the whites. For
picnics, fasten two halves together with a wooden
toothpick.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SCRAMBLED EGGS</b></div>

<p>Beat the desired number enough to break the
yolks, season with salt and pepper, and add a tablespoonful
of milk for each egg. Put in a hot
pan half a teaspoonful of butter for each egg, and
when melted, pour in the beaten eggs. Stir constantly,
scraping from the bottom of the pan
until cooked enough to suit individual taste, but
watch closely, for the longer they cook the drier
they become. Garnish with parsley or with dried
beef, frizzled in a hot skillet with a small quantity
of butter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BACON AND EGGS</b></div>

<p>Place thin slices of bacon in a hot skillet, turn
frequently to keep from curling, and remove to a
hot plate when cooked as much as desired. Break
eggs in a saucer, one at a time, to see that they
are fresh, then drop gently into the hot fat. When
done to suit individual taste, lift carefully to the
center of a hot platter, and garnish with the
bacon.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The secret of an attractive table, which should
be made clear to every girl, is clean linen, with
dishes and silver carefully arranged. Each article
of food, however simple, should be carefully
placed in the center of its dish, and vegetables,
meats and salads garnished with parsley, celery
leaves, or occasionally rings of hard-boiled eggs.
The eggs are especially nice on salads and on
such a vegetable as spinach.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A kitchen lesson would be incomplete without a
few words regarding the care of the all-important
dish-towels and dish-cloth. However many
may be on hand, it is a wise plan to teach the little
cook to take warm water and plenty of soap
and wash them out each time, being careful to
rinse them thoroughly after she is through. Then
hang out in the air to dry.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Using Odds and Ends</div>


<p>Every mother, in teaching her little daughter
to cook, should impress upon her two essential
points&mdash;economy and neatness. A cook cannot be
too careful to have her materials, her utensils, and
herself as clean as possible. So, before beginning
work, the child should carefully wash her hands,
clean her nails, smooth up any stray locks of hair,
and put on the cap, sleeves and apron that are to
protect her from spots and flying flour. Then all
fruits or vegetables which are to be used should
be well washed before being peeled, and the cooking
utensils wiped off. Sometimes the pans or the
stewing kettle have not been used for days, and
there is sure to be a certain amount of dust on
these that is almost imperceptible, but nevertheless
unwholesome and often dangerous.</p>

<p>Following the instructions regarding cleanliness,
and of equal importance, is the lesson in the
economical use of materials on hand. Anyone can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
take a recipe calling for all fresh materials and,
with a little care, turn out a successful dish; but
it takes a culinary artist to successfully work up
the odds and ends found in the ice-box and pantry.
In small families these bits can be made into
attractive dishes for luncheon, or, in case of an
unexpected guest, converted into an additional
course. In the line of vegetables, for instance,
there may be left a few leaves of lettuce, a couple
of tomatoes, the remains of a roast, a small quantity
of chicken, and a bottle of sour milk. Not
very promising, certainly, in the ice-box, but full
of possibilities. The little cook is going to be a
magician, and by a wave of her wand (the cook-book,)
make a grand transformation.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COTTAGE CHEESE</b></div>

<p>First the sour milk! Not attractive as sour
milk, but most delicious as cream cheese. Set one
quart of sour milk on the stove where it will warm
slowly, and let stand until the curd and whey separate.
Spread a piece of cheese-cloth or an old
napkin over a colander, pour in the curds and let
drain until quite dry. This may take a couple of
hours, and it is a good plan to warm the milk
while getting the supper and then let stand all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
night. Next put the curds in a bowl and rub to
a paste with one teaspoonful of butter, a saltspoonful
of salt and a tablespoonful of cream.
When smooth, mold into little balls if to be
served with a salad.</p>

<span class="caption">A Table Set for a Valentine Luncheon</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>NUT CHEESE CRACKERS</b></div>

<p>Nut cheese crackers are most appetizing, too,
made by spreading this cheese on small saltine
crackers, and sprinkling chopped nuts over the
top. Any child will delight to make these, and
while easy and cheap, they are attractive enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to serve any company. Or, the cheese can be
served, French fashion, with a little heavy cream
and a small quantity of richly preserved currants
or cherries, (Bar-le-duc,) for dessert.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/img027-big.jpg"><img src="images/img027.jpg" width="600" height="369" alt="Fresh Vegetable Salad" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fresh Vegetable Salad</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>STUFFED PEPPERS</b></div>

<p>If there is too little of the roast to serve sliced
cold, it can be chopped fine, seasoned well with
salt and pepper and moistened with the cold
gravy. If the quantity is still too small, it can be
increased by adding a beaten egg and half a cupful
of dried bread-crumbs. This works into a nice
dish by taking sweet green peppers, splitting in
half, washing and removing the seeds, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
packing with the minced meat. Bake until peppers
are tender, about half an hour, then remove
from oven, lay on squares of hot toast, and cover
with white sauce or warmed-over gravy.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WHITE SAUCE</b></div>

<p>Good white sauce is needed for so many different
kinds of vegetable, fish and meat dishes, that
a child should be taught it at the beginning of
her work. Have her melt one tablespoon of butter
and stir in one tablespoon of flour. When
smooth, add slowly one cup of milk, stirring all
the time to keep from getting lumpy. If lumps
do form, however, before the child has learned the
secret of mixing, she can strain after it has cooked
five minutes. Season with quarter-teaspoon of
salt and a dash of pepper. For brown sauce, simply
brown the flour and butter before adding the
milk.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAMED CHICKEN</b></div>

<p>A small quantity of chicken is often left from
dinner, yet not enough to serve cold. Let the
mother show the child how to cut off every bit of
meat from the bones&mdash;and she will get more than
she expects from wings and necks. But all pieces
of fat and skin must be discarded.   Then for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
hot dish, making a white sauce first, she can stir
in the minced chicken, let it cook a few moments,
and serve on rounds of buttered toast.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHICKEN CROQUETTES</b></div>

<p>Still another way, if the quantity is small, is to
add to one cupful of chopped chicken one-half
cupful of rolled bread-crumbs, a half cupful of hot
milk, two well-beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of
chopped parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
This is to be shaped into croquettes, dipped in
rolled bread-crumbs, beaten egg, crumbs again,
and browned in hot fat.</p>

<p>White sauce served on the side will make it
doubly attractive; and if the quantity is still small
for the number to be served, it will go farther and
be made more savory if garnished with curls of
crisp bacon.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHICKEN SALAD</b></div>

<p>If a cold dish is desired, let her add an equal
amount of finely cut celery, season with salt and
pepper, moisten with cooked salad dressing, and
she will have a delicious chicken salad. To be
particularly nice, however, she should use only the
white meat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Our little cook should be taught the first thing
how to make a good salad dressing, for into a
salad it is almost always possible to turn the left-overs
that otherwise might be thrown out. Only
one other thing (soup) will use up as many scraps
in making nourishing as well as appetizing dishes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BOILED SALAD DRESSING</b></div>

<p>As many people do not care for the flavor of
oil, a nice easy dressing is made by taking two
tablespoonfuls butter, rubbed to a cream, to which
is added one teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful
mustard, a dash of red pepper, and one cupful
hot milk. Stirring well, this should immediately
be poured on the beaten yolks of three eggs, and
then cooked in a double boiler until thick. Remove
from the fire, add one-quarter of a cup of
vinegar, and stir until cool. When to be used
in fruit salads, add half a cup of thick cream just
before serving. But eggs and milk curdle if
boiled.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRENCH DRESSING</b></div>

<p>Easily made is the French dressing, and often
prepared at the table. To one-quarter teaspoonful
of finely minced onion, add one-half teaspoonful
salt, a little black pepper, a few grains of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Cayenne and six teaspoonfuls olive oil. Stir well,
add two teaspoonfuls vinegar, and mix thoroughly.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRESH VEGETABLE SALAD</b></div>

<p>To make the best of the few vegetables we have
found on hand, wash the lettuce carefully (looking
out for the tiny green bugs found on some
kinds,) and arrange on a plate. Peel and slice
the two tomatoes, and lay lightly on the lettuce,
with a few bits of celery, several radishes or some
thin slices of cucumber if available, and cover with
salad dressing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/img031-big.jpg"><img src="images/img031.jpg" width="500" height="307" alt="Heart Salad" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Heart Salad</span>
</div>

<p>For the heart salad illustrated, cut cold boiled
beets into heart-shaped sections, and serve on lettuce
hearts, with French dressing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COOKED VEGETABLE SALAD</b></div>

<p>Small quantities of cooked vegetables, such as
beets, string beans, asparagus, peas and boiled
potatoes, make a nice salad cut into small pieces,
laid on lettuce leaves and covered with French
dressing. But they must be thoroughly chilled.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CABBAGE SALAD</b></div>

<p>Cabbage salad is possible at all seasons of the
year, and should be one of the first that the child
should learn to make. Insist on getting small,
perfect heads, and have the leaves removed one at
a time, examined closely and washed as carefully
as lettuce, for fear of worms. After chopping
finely, the desired quantity is to be seasoned with
salt and pepper and served on the small, tender
white leaves, with the following dressing:</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SOUR CREAM DRESSING</b></div>

<p>To half a cup of thick sour cream, add half a
teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of sugar, a
dash of black pepper, and two teaspoonsful of
strong vinegar.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRESH FRUIT SALAD</b></div>

<p>Almost all kinds of fruit are used in salads.
Bananas and oranges, alone or together, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
served on lettuce with the cream salad dressing,
as are also the skinned and seeded white grapes.
Pineapple and grapefruit are delicious with head
lettuce, served with the French dressing containing
but a few drops of the onion juice. Then
again, all may be combined, served with either
dressing preferred, and improved by the addition
of a few nuts.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WALDORF SALAD</b></div>

<p>For four people have the little cook take four
pretty red apples, cut a slice off the top, and
after removing the core, carefully cut out with a
teaspoon the inside of each without breaking the
skin. Taking half the scooped-out apple, she must
add an equal amount of celery (cut in small
pieces) and chopped English walnuts, one teaspoonful
salt and boiled dressing enough to cover.
After tossing up lightly with a fork pack in the
apple shells, and when possible serve in nests made
of lettuce cut in strings.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GREEN PEPPER SALAD</b></div>

<p>Take sweet green peppers, cut a slice from the
top, remove seeds, and fill with either the mixed
vegetables or diced cucumbers, covered with
French dressing. Serve on lettuce.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Some Easy Soups</div>


<p>Every little cook should early be taught how
to make a variety of soups, as many small quantities
of food can be utilized in this way that otherwise
might be wasted.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>STOCK</b></div>

<p>Take, for instance, the bones and small trimmings
from steaks, chops or a roast, and the remnant
of a chicken. These, with a five-cent soup
bone, will make the stock, which is the foundation
for a great many kinds of soup. If part of the
scraps have been fried or roasted, so much the
better, as then the stock will be a delicate brown
and have even a richer taste. The meat, cut in
small cubes, with the bones well cracked, should
be covered with twice the quantity of cold water
and allowed to stand for several hours.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CLEAR VEGETABLE SOUP</b></div>

<p>Any kind of vegetables on hand can be put in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
at the same time, a small onion cut in slices, a
little chopped carrot, turnip, a few string beans
cut in inch lengths, half a cupful of peas, a couple
of stalks of celery, a few sprigs of parsley, together
with three or four cloves and salt and pepper
to taste. If these vegetables with the meat
fill the kettle one-third full, then it can be filled
to the top with cold water. After standing several
hours it should be placed where it will heat
slowly and allowed to simmer for two hours, then
strained and set aside to cool and let the grease
come to the top. When it is cold the cake of fat
can easily be lifted off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/img035-big.jpg"><img src="images/img035.jpg" width="500" height="344" alt="Green-Pepper Salad" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Green-Pepper Salad</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'CONSOMME'">CONSOMM&Eacute;</ins> AND BOUILLON</b></div>

<p>Then to make the finest kind of perfectly clear
soup, stir into each two quarts of cold stock the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
beaten white and crushed shell of one egg, place
on the fire and keep stirring until it boils. Allow
to cook without stirring for twenty minutes, after
which set aside for ten minutes; skim and strain
through a cheese-cloth bag. This may seem like
a good deal of work, but if the soup is first boiled
in the morning while cleaning up the kitchen and
then clarified while getting dinner, it will not require
much time nor trouble, and the result will
be a delicious consomm&eacute; or bouillon. It is called
bouillon if made principally of beef with vegetables,
and brown in color; it is consomm&eacute; if made
of uncooked meat and bones, including veal and
chicken, and consequently light in color.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PLEASING VARIATIONS</b></div>

<p>Stock made thus can be simply reheated or
changed to any desired kind of soup by the addition
of a particular garnishing. For rice soup,
either a few teaspoonfuls of uncooked rice or half
a teacupful of cold boiled rice can be added; for
vegetable soup a cupful of mixed vegetables cut
in small pieces can be put in and boiled until tender.
Macaroni, broken in inch lengths, washed
and then cooked in the stock until it is done makes
a nice change, called Italian consomm&eacute;, while a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
cupful of tomatoes will convert it into a tomato
soup. If the additions suggested are to be made,
however, it is not necessary to clarify the stock.
It takes common sense to make good soup, as well
as time and patience, and one must learn to be
guided by the taste if trying to use up left-overs
instead of following a regular recipe.</p>

<p>Cream soups, however, do not require any stock,
and so are easily and quickly made. They are
delicious, too, and something any bright girl could
make while her mother got up the rest of the dinner.
They take the name of the kind of vegetable
used, but all are put together in about the same
way.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAM OF CELERY</b></div>

<p>For cream of celery take two cupfuls of diced
celery, using the leaves, ends and coarse pieces not
good enough to send to the table uncooked. Cover
with two cupfuls of cold water, season with salt
and allow to cook until tender&mdash;about twenty minutes.
While this is boiling the little maid mixes
in another pan two tablespoonfuls of melted butter
with two tablespoonfuls of flour. Placing it
over the fire, she adds three cupfuls of milk and
stirs for five minutes while it boils. After seasoning
with salt and pepper and a dash of red pepper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pour in the strained water from the cooked
celery and boil all gently on the back of the stove
for five minutes before serving.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PEA AND ASPARAGUS</b></div>

<p>For cream of pea soup, simply substitute two
cupfuls of cooked peas that have been pressed
through a colander. For cream of asparagus
boil up first two cupfuls of the tough ends of the
asparagus that would not do for the table, or
take two cupfuls of the water used in cooking the
asparagus for dinner and put with the thickened
milk. But in order to avoid giving the family the
same vegetable twice at a meal, it is best to save
the asparagus water or the celery ends until another
time, putting in the ice-box to keep fresh.
We all like variety, and in this way it can be had
without extra expense.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAM OF POTATO</b></div>

<p>Cream of potato soup is made by adding two
scant cupfuls of mashed potato to the milk foundation
given. Some people like the addition of a
half-teaspoonful of onion juice to flavor or a tablespoonful
of chopped bacon. If too thick it can
be thinned with some of the boiling potato water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It is advisable for the mother to have the child
make a certain cream soup twice in close succession
to be sure that she thoroughly understands
the process, and then make each of the other kinds
soon after, so that she will get used to using up
whatever left-overs she finds on hand.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BLACK BEAN SOUP</b></div>

<p>Black beans make a particularly nice soup for
a company dinner. To two cupfuls of the dried
beans use four cupfuls of cold water and let stand
over night. Next day add two cupfuls of boiling
water and cook until the beans are perfectly tender,
with one small chopped onion, three cloves,
salt, pepper and a dash of cayenne. Melt two
tablespoonfuls of butter, stir in two tablespoonfuls
of flour, add a cupful of cold water; cook the
same as the milk foundation and add to the beans
after they have been put through a colander. Boil
up well together, stirring to blend well. Put a
couple of thin slices of hard-boiled egg and lemon
in each plate and pour the hot soup in. If desired,
the soup can be additionally flavored with
a small wineglassful of sour wine.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAM OF TOMATO</b></div>

<p>Before leaving the soup question, let me say
that the cream of tomato is made by heating two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cupfuls of canned tomatoes to the boiling point,
then straining, and after adding a good-sized
pinch of soda, which must be stirred in well, poured
slowly on to the milk foundation, prepared in
another vessel. This must be served immediately,
as it is not so good when allowed to stand.</p>

<img src="images/img040.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Tossing Up a Salad" title="" />
<span class="caption">Tossing Up a Salad</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DELECTABLE GARNISHES</b></div>

<p>Instead of always serving the ordinary crackers,
teach the child how to prepare some simple
little extras for nice soups. Plain square crackers
spread with butter, salted and then browned in
the oven will taste quite different; another time let
her grate the least bit of cheese over before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
toasting. Or she can take stale bread, cut in long
narrow strips, spread with butter, season with
salt and pepper and bake a light brown in a slow
oven. Cro&ucirc;tons, too, are a welcomed variety,
made by cutting bread in half-inch cubes, dipping
in melted butter and frying crisp. A few of these
are scattered on top of each plate of soup just
before sending to the table. Such extras require
but little time, yet they mark the experienced
cook; and if our small maid has been paying due
attention to her directions (and consequently getting
good results in her work,) she ought now to
be so interested that she will be eager to try every
new dish suggested and desirous of making the
greatest possible number of dishes out of each
particular kind of food.</p>

<p>Now let us review and see what we have out of
the odds and ends that we found that we had on
hand to start with, and what a luncheon it would
make. We should have either a soup or the stuffed
peppers for a first course, salad for a second, and
the cheese crackers served with a small quantity
of jam or preserves for a finish! Quite a nice meal,
and one we need not hesitate to set before an unexpected
guest. Besides, from any reasonable
quantity of left-overs there would probably be
enough for four people.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Fish, Fresh and Dried</div>


<p>Fresh fish, in the first place, must be absolutely
fresh. They will have little odor, the eyes will be
full and clear, and the flesh firm. They are usually
delivered from the market cleaned and scaled, but
they should be washed with cold water, and sprinkled
with salt if not used immediately.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SMELTS, TROUT AND PERCH</b></div>

<p>Smelts, trout, perch and other small fish, are
fried whole, while the larger kinds are cut in pieces
called fillets. After washing, drying and seasoning
with pepper and salt, each piece should be
dipped in finely rolled, dried bread or corn meal,
and laid on the bread-board. When all through,
beginning with the first, dip each one in well-beaten,
seasoned egg, and then in the crumbs
again, taking pains to have them covered completely.
Lay back on the board to dry before
cooking. Heat a half cupful of lard in a skillet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
until smoking hot, then put in the fish and fry on
one side until brown. Turn carefully to avoid
breaking, and brown on the other side, but do
not turn more than once, and watch to keep from
burning. Many cooks use flour or rolled crackers
for covering the fish, but the bread crumbs do
not hold as much grease, and the fish always seem
to fry better than when dipped in anything else.
When cooked a deep, rich brown, lift out on to
brown paper to drain, and then slip on to a hot
platter and send to the table at once, garnished
with slices of lemon, parsley or water cress.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>HALIBUT</b></div>

<p>A halibut steak is fine when, after washing
thoroughly, it is put in a dripping pan, seasoned
with salt and pepper, covered with boiling water
and cooked in the oven until done,&mdash;from twenty
minutes to half an hour. While it is cooking, our
little maid can prepare her favorite white sauce,
only now she must add a cupful of strained tomatoes
and season with red pepper. When the fish
is ready, she must serve it on a hot platter, covered
with the hot sauce. A steak of this kind
usually weighs about two pounds, and is ample
for four or five people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WHITE, WEAK AND BLUE FISH</b></div>

<p>White fish, weak fish, blue fish and similar kinds
I like best when large enough to have the bones
first removed and the fish then spread, skin down,
on a wire broiler, or an oak plank. Spread with a
little butter and seasoned with pepper and salt, it
may be cooked in a gas stove or before a hot fire.
This will take from twenty to thirty minutes.
When thoroughly done and browned on top, garnish
with roses of mashed potato, lemon or parsley,
and serve immediately,&mdash;right on the plank
if desired. Any left over can be picked into small
pieces, and worked up with an equal amount of
cold mashed potato, into cakes, to be fried for
breakfast.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of smoked and canned
fish that make specially appetizing dishes for
breakfast or luncheon. They should always be
kept in the house, with other shelf supplies, and
will prove "a friend in need."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FINNAN HADDIE</b></div>

<p>Finnan Haddie can be served in several ways.
After washing and wiping off with a cloth, it can
be buttered, seasoned with salt and pepper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
either broiled or fried. Or it is even better if
boiled first for five minutes (put on it cold water),
then picked into small flakes and stirred into our
little maid's standby, white sauce. After cooking
five minutes longer, it should be served on rounds
of hot buttered toast, garnished with parsley.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SMOKED FISH</b></div>

<p>Smoked halibut, salmon and sturgeon can all be
bought in small pieces (even as little as half a
pound), and are most inviting when cut into thin
slices and made hot in a skillet with just enough
butter to keep them from burning.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SALT COD</b></div>

<p>But in talking of dried fish, we must not forget
our old favorite, creamed codfish. As the boxed
codfish is always so salty, it is necessary, after
picking it carefully apart and removing the bones,
to let it soak in cold water for half an hour, then
drain. Put half a cupful of fish on in a stewpan,
cover with cold water and let come to a boil. Pour
this off immediately, cover with fresh boiling water,
and let gently simmer for ten minutes. While
it is cooking, our small maid should rub to a
smooth paste one tablespoon of flour and one tablespoon
of butter. Then adding one cup of milk
and one well-beaten egg to the codfish, she next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
puts in the paste, and continues to stir for five
minutes more while it is cooking. It should then
be served on rounds of hot toast.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>SALT MACKEREL</b></div>

<p>Salt mackerel should be covered with cold water
and left skin side up to soak over night. For
breakfast, dry in a cloth and broil, with the flesh
side toward the fire, or else brown in a hot pan
with a little butter, and serve on a hot platter
garnished with slices of lemon.</p>

<p>I have purposely avoided giving recipes calling
for frying in deep fat, as there is always more or
less danger of an inexperienced child meeting with
an accident in handling any quantity of melted
lard, but mothers who wish to use it will find that
fritters, fish and other things when cooked that
way get a nice color and really take up less fat
than when fried (saut&eacute;d) in the more common
style.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Simple Meat Dishes</div>


<p>Here let me put in a few words about some easy
ways of cooking meat. The recipes are simple,
but everything depends on your getting in plenty
of seasoning, cooking as directed, and&mdash;not burning.
Be sure to have veal, lamb and pork well
done, as no one likes these rare or even pink, but
study the family taste about the length of time to
cook beef. I have purposely omitted the ordinary
dinner meats (I couldn't tell you everything in
one little book!), but if you learn to make what
I <i>do</i> tell you about, you will certainly become a
good cook.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PAN-BROILED LAMB CHOPS</b></div>

<p>Lamb chops are particularly nice pan-broiled.
First scrape off any fine particles of bone, trim
off superfluous fat, and then place in a hissing
hot skillet. Turn often until well seared, to prevent
escape of juices, and cook until brown, about
ten minutes. Serve on a hot platter, season with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
salt and pepper, dot with butter, and garnish
with parsley, peas, or a ring of mashed potatoes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PORK CHOPS</b></div>

<p>Pork chops need to be thoroughly cooked, and
after washing, I always parboil ten minutes first
in a covered frying pan, then season with salt and
pepper and brown in fat. They are often served
with tomato sauce.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/img049-big.jpg"><img src="images/img049.jpg" width="500" height="298" alt="Veal Cutlet as Reed Birds" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Veal Cutlet as Reed Birds</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>VEAL CUTLETS</b></div>

<p>The veal for this purpose, sometimes called
Mock Reed Birds, should be sliced thin, then cut
in four-inch squares. Spread lightly with butter,
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and scatter with
finely minced parsley and celery, or either one
alone. Roll each piece up tightly and tie with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
piece of white string. Place "birds" in a hot
skillet with a little water and melted butter, cover
and simmer for twenty minutes, then brown in
butter or fat as preferred. Serve on rounds of hot
buttered toast, with brown gravy.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BEEF STEW (BROWN)</b></div>

<p>Take one pound of round steak, cut in small
pieces and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put a
little suet in a hot kettle, or melt two tablespoons
of butter, and add a couple of slices of dry onion,
turning frequently until brown, then put in the
meat. Stir to keep from scorching until well
seared on all sides, cover with boiling water, and
set on the back of the stove to simmer for at
least three hours. As it boils down, allow to brown
before filling up again, and have the meat covered
with the broth when done. Thicken with two
tablespoons of flour stirred to a smooth paste in
half a cup of cold water. Add more salt then if
necessary. Send to the table in a covered dish,
and serve with mashed potatoes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SOUTHERN BAKED HAM</b></div>

<p>When there is going to be company, baked ham
is one of the nicest kinds of meat that can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had. Take either a small end or half a ham, as
needed, and soak several hours in cold water.
Wash well and put on in a kettle with cold water
to cover and boil slowly, allowing at least twenty
minutes to the pound. After boiling half an
hour, remove one-third the water, and fill up with
fresh boiling water, and keep covered until done.
Then set aside and allow to cool in the liquor.
When cold, lift out, trim off the brown skin, cover
the fat with brown sugar, stick with whole cloves,
and bake brown&mdash;about twenty or thirty minutes.
This is delicious either hot or cold.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BEEFSTEAK</b></div>

<p>Different kinds of steak need to be cooked in
different ways. Tenderloin, porterhouse, and sirloin
are best broiled over a hot fire, or pan broiled
by being turned frequently on a very hot skillet,
with only the fat that comes from the steak itself.
Serve on a hot platter, with butter, pepper and
salt. Round steak is nice cut in small pieces, seasoned
with salt and pepper, rolled in flour, and
cooked quickly in some of the suet, first put in the
pan until tried out. Lift browned pieces of the
steak (for this needs more cooking than tenderer
meat), on to a hot platter, add a little butter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the fat in the pan, stir in a scant tablespoon of
flour, stir well until smooth and brown, then pour
in quickly a cupful of cold water, and continue to
stir until well thickened. This gravy will be
smooth and of nice flavor, and can be poured over
the meat. Season, of course, with salt and pepper
to taste.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>HASH</b></div>

<p>Hash, though a dish often laughed at, is always
appetizing when well made. Corn beef hash
indeed has quite a reputation, and is made by
chopping cold corn beef rather fine, adding an
equal quantity of cold boiled potatoes, chopped,
wetting with enough boiling water to keep from
burning, seasoning with salt, pepper and a little
butter, and then allowing to cook gently for at
least twenty minutes. All kinds of hash need to
simmer for quite a while, in order to blend the
flavor of the meat and the potatoes, and give the
delicate taste that marks a carefully prepared
dish. Beef, particularly browned scraps, finely
minced, and mixed with an equal quantity of
minced cold boiled potatoes, seasoned and prepared
as just directed, is very good for breakfast
served on rounds of buttered toast. And either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
kind can be allowed to brown down in the pan
and then turned out on a hot plate, rolled over
with a nice thick crust. Any kind of meat can
be used, however.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LAMB PIE</b></div>

<p>A lamb pie is an attractive way of using up
small pieces of cold lamb. Cut off all scraps and
gristle, and add enough cold gravy to cover. Season
well with salt and pepper, and simmer twenty
minutes. Take a pudding dish, invert a small
cup in the bottom, pour in the hot meat, add half
a can of peas, cover with a crust of light biscuit
dough, and bake until brown. Before sending to
the table lift crust and remove cup, which has
drawn up the gravy. Serve with either mashed
or baked potatoes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DRIED BEEF</b></div>

<p>Dried beef dressed in cream is always an appetizing
dish and very quickly made ready. The
child should first take a half-pound of chipped
beef and tear it into small pieces, removing all
strings and fat. Then put in a stew-pan, cover
with cold water and let come to a boil. While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it is heating, however, she should stir smooth
one tablespoonful butter and one tablespoonful
flour. When the water boils on the
beef she must pour off half (or it will be too
salty), and add an equal amount of milk. Into
this stir slowly the mixed butter and flour, season
with pepper and let boil until thick. Some people
like the addition of two well-beaten eggs, but
I prefer the beef plain, with the gravy rather
thick, served on rounds of hot buttered toast.
The toast could be made first and set where it
will keep warm, and thus save the time of making
afterwards, for a dish of this kind cools very
quickly, and should be sent to the table as soon
as ready.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/img054-big.jpg"><img src="images/img054.jpg" width="600" height="347" alt="A Standing Roast of Beef" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">A Standing Roast of Beef</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>ROAST BEEF</b></div>

<p>A roast of beef, after being scraped and wiped
free from all particles of sawed bone, should be
seasoned well with salt and pepper, and dredged
with flour. Put it in a hot oven, and when it has
seared on top, to keep in the juice, turn over and
allow to sear on the bottom. Then pour in the
pan enough boiling water to keep from burning,
and baste frequently. Allow about one hour for
a five pound roast rare, and an hour and a half
to cook well done. Serve a rib roast, left on the
bone, standing as shown in the illustration, garnished
with parsley.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Interesting Potato</div>


<p>Every girl should know how to cook potatoes
properly; yet really there is scarcely any other
one vegetable that can be prepared in so many
ways and still is often so poorly cooked as to be
practically unfit to eat. It would seem an easy
thing to make a light, appetizing dish of mashed
potatoes&mdash;and what is more inviting?&mdash;but how
often are they served wet and soggy! To understand
the right way to cook and serve potatoes
is as much an art as to make a salad or bake a
cake.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BOILED POTATOES</b></div>

<p>Plain boiled potatoes, with the skin on, are delicious
when cooked as they should be. The requisite
number should be selected, perfect in form
and uniform in size, and scrubbed with the vegetable
brush, but the skins not broken. If they
are old they will be better for soaking half an
hour in cold water. A half hour before dinner-time,
if they are of medium size, they should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
covered with boiling salted water and placed on
the stove, where they will boil gently, not hard,
until the skins begin to crack open. Test with
a fork, and as soon as they are tender, drain off
all the water and set on the back of the stove to
steam dry. Serve in a hot, open vegetable dish;
and if there is company or you are very particular,
remove the skins (without breaking the potatoes)
just before sending to the table. In case
there is to be fish or a meat dish without gravy,
serve the potatoes with the white sauce our little
cook was taught to make in one of her first lessons.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MASHED POTATOES</b></div>

<p>For mashed potatoes the mother should tell the
child to pick out the imperfect ones, or those too
large to bake, to be peeled and cut up. Have
her put them on in boiling salted water half an
hour before dinner-time, cook until perfectly tender,
then drain and let steam dry. After standing
a few moments (in a hot place), have her
mash them thoroughly, first with an old-fashioned
wooden masher until all the lumps are removed,
and then with a wire one. To each cupful of
potato add a teaspoonful of butter and a tablespoonful
of hot milk. They should be beaten up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
creamy with the wire beater, then turned out into
a hot covered dish, with a lump of butter in the
center and a sprinkling of pepper over the top,
and served at once.</p>

<p>If dinner is delayed, however, and there is danger
of their getting cold, have her put them in a
baking-dish or tin, smooth them nicely over the
top and set where they will keep warm. Then
when needed, if she will grate a little cheese over
the top and put in the oven for a few minutes to
brown, she will find that they are even nicer than
when first made. The mashed potatoes left from
dinner can be worked up with a little cream and
molded into small round cakes, to be fried brown
next morning.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAMED POTATOES</b></div>

<p>Often in buying potatoes one finds a quantity
of little ones usually considered "too small to be
bothered with." They seem hardly worth peeling,
but if scrubbed clean and boiled as directed
the skins can be removed quickly when they are
tender. Then if a white sauce is made, these little
potato balls can be dropped in and served
garnished with finely chopped parsley on top.
This is a favorite way of preparing new potatoes
and most appetizing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LYONNAISE POTATOES</b></div>

<p>If the mother prefers, she can have the child
take these little balls (peeled after they are
cooked), cut them up fine, and fry them as follows:
In a hot pan melt two tablespoonfuls of
butter and add a teaspoonful of finely chopped
onion, which should be cooked until a delicate
brown before the seasoned potatoes are added.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHEESE POTATOES</b></div>

<p>Parboil sliced potatoes, or slice cold boiled ones,
line the bottom of a baking dish, sprinkle with
salt, pepper, a little flour, grated cheese, and
dots of butter. Repeat until the pan is nearly
full, cover with milk, sprinkle the top with the
grated cheese, and bake until brown, or about
half an hour. Cheese potatoes are particularly
good served with cold meat.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BAKED POTATOES</b></div>

<p>Potatoes for baking should be of uniform, medium
size and perfect. After being well scrubbed
they should be wiped dry and put in a moderate
oven three-quarters of an hour before meal-time.
If the meal is delayed for any reason they should
be pricked with a fork in several places to let out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the steam, and then set where they will keep hot,
but not in a covered dish, or they will get wet
and soggy.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>STUFFED POTATOES</b></div>

<p>If it is necessary to keep them any length of
time, cut off the end of each potato, scrape out
the inside, season with salt, pepper, a little butter,
a small quantity of cream and to every three
potatoes one egg, the white beaten stiff. After
whipping up light put back in the shells, where
they will keep warm. Just before sending to the
table, put in the oven for a few moments, until
they puff up and brown at the ends.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRIED POTATOES</b></div>

<p>Cold boiled potatoes can be used in so many
different ways that where there is no servant in
the house it often is a saving of time and labor
to boil a quantity at one time and then heat up
as needed. They are nice simply sliced thin and
fried brown in butter.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>HASHED CREAM POTATOES</b></div>

<p>If this is considered too rich, half the amount
of butter will be sufficient to flavor and keep from
scorching, and then when they brown as they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hashed in the pan pour in a few spoonfuls of
cream. Season well, allow to brown down again,
then fold like an omelet and serve on a hot platter
garnished with parsley.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SCALLOPED POTATOES</b></div>

<p>Scalloped potatoes are very nice for a supper
dish, as they can be prepared early in the day
and set away until needed. The little cook, after
washing and peeling her potatoes, next cuts them
in thin slices, enough to fill the dish needed and
parboils in salted water for ten minutes. Then
drain. Arrange a layer of these, with a sprinkling
of flour, pepper and salt and a few small
pieces of butter, repeating in layers until the pan
is full. Pour over enough milk to cover. When
ready to cook, allow half an hour for the baking,
and from time to time add a little extra hot milk.
It is well to set a large pan containing water
under the baking-dish to catch any milk that
might boil over and burn on the bottom of the
oven.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CANDIED SWEET POTATOES</b></div>

<p>Sweet potatoes that have been boiled are particularly
nice when cut in half, buttered, seasoned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with very little salt and pepper and then sprinkled
over the top with granulated sugar and browned
in the oven. "Candied sweet potatoes" they are
called when served in hotels as something extra.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Different Kinds of Vegetables</div>


<p>A mother can make the cooking of potatoes
and the plainer vegetables interesting if she will
use a little tact and stimulate the child's desire
to make, first, as many different dishes from each
article as possible, and second, to make them as
appetizing as she can. Doubtless many a girl
who will not eat plain food now could be taught
to like things by getting her interested in cooking,
for then she has to taste and make sure she
has seasoned properly.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>TURNIPS, CARROTS</b></div>

<p>Such winter vegetables as turnips, carrots and
parsnips should be well washed, peeled, cut in
small pieces and cooked in boiling salted water
for sixty minutes, more or less, depending on the
age of the vegetables, as the older they are the
longer they will take to get tender. When sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
cooked they should be drained and may
then be mashed, seasoned with pepper and salt
and butter and served in a hot covered dish. Or
if preferred they can be left in the cubes and
served with our little cook's favorite white sauce
poured over. If mashed they are to be served on
the dinner plate, but if in cream sauce they will
have to be put in individual sauce-dishes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PARSNIPS</b></div>

<p>Plain boiled parsnips are delicious if cut in
slices and fried in butter, as they acquire a sweetness
not brought out in any other way of cooking.
If the left-over quantity is mashed, it can
be made into little flat cakes and browned in butter.
The child should be encouraged to think of
as many different ways as possible and then allowed
to experiment and see the result.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WINTER SQUASH</b></div>

<p>Winter squash is good prepared in the same
way as the mashed parsnips&mdash;that is, plain
boiled and then mashed, but I prefer the Hubbard
variety, cut in large squares and baked in the
shell&mdash;without being peeled. Season before putting
on the oven shelf, spread with a little butter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and add a slight sprinkling of granulated sugar.
This will take about three-quarters of an hour
to bake, and should be a light brown over the
top. The child may have some difficulty in cutting
a Hubbard squash, as it is so hard, but she
can prepare it after it has been cut for her.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DRIED LIMA BEANS</b></div>

<p>Put to soak half a pound of dried Lima beans
in a small quantity of cold water. Next morning
set where they will simmer slowly for two
hours in salted water enough to cover. At dinner-time
drain, and serve on the dinner plates
simply seasoned with butter, pepper and salt. Or,
if preferred, they can be served in sauce dishes,
with white sauce.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BOILED CABBAGE</b></div>

<p>A nice way to serve cabbage hot is to chop
fine after it has soaked half an hour in cold
water, put on in boiling salted water, and cook
in an open kettle with a pinch of soda, about
forty minutes or until tender. Then drain and
serve immediately with butter, pepper and salt,
or with white sauce. Some people prefer to add
simply a little vinegar, so find out the family
taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BAKED BEANS</b></div>

<p>For a small family, soak one pint of the small
navy beans over night, and next morning boil
gently until nearly tender. Drain, throw away
that water, and add a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoon
of molasses and a cupful of boiling water.
Cut a quarter of a pound of salt pork in small
pieces, put half of the beans in a baking dish, add
a layer of half the pork, fill up with the rest of
the beans and lay the rest of the pork around
over the top. Cover the beans with boiling water,
put a tin over the dish, and bake a number of
hours,&mdash;the longer the better. As the water
boils away, add enough more to keep from burning,
and half an hour before serving, uncover
and allow to brown over the top. If a slow fire
is going in the range, the beans will be the better
for cooking most of the day, but they must
be watched to keep from burning. However, they
will taste very fine if boiled longer at first,&mdash;until
perfectly tender, and then baked only an
hour.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAMED ONIONS</b></div>

<p>Peel off the outside skin, cover with boiling
water, cook five minutes, drain, and cover with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fresh boiling water, well salted. Cook until tender,
the length of time depending on the size,
then drain and serve in a hot covered vegetable
dish with white sauce, made while the onions were
cooking.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BAKED ONIONS</b></div>

<p>First boil as above directed, then lift into a
piepan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place a
small lump of butter in a little hole on top of
each, and bake until brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>ASPARAGUS</b></div>

<p>With the coming of the spring vegetables will
be opened a new field for the child to explore.
Asparagus, one of the first in the market, is considered
one of the choicest, and it is also one of
the most easily prepared. To retain all the delicate
flavor many people think it should be served
plain. For this, tie the asparagus in bunches,
after washing carefully and snapping off the
tough ends. Set upright in a deep kettle and
pour over boiling salted water enough to reach
nearly to the tips, but do not cover. The tender<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ends will cook enough at first, for ten minutes,
in the steam, and then the bunches should be
turned down sideways for thirty minutes more.
Lift carefully with a skimmer, allowing the water
to run off, lay on a hot platter, remove the strings
and serve immediately with tiny lumps of butter
and a dash of pepper over the top. Or the asparagus
can be first cut in small lengths, boiled
until tender in salted water, then drained, laid
on hot toast and covered with cream sauce. As
mentioned before, the water in which it has been
cooked can be set away to be used for soup, with
a few tips added if desired.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CUCUMBER JELLY</b></div>

<p>Take one pint of well-seasoned bouillon, and
while still warm, add the quantity of gelatine
stated on the package necessary to make one pint
of jelly, and when thoroughly dissolved, set away
until it begins to stiffen. Then slice one cucumber,
after peeling and ridging the sides, season
with salt and pepper, and lay in vinegar for a
moment. Rinse out the mould in cold water, lay
around the cucumber in any pattern desired, and
fill up the mould with the thickening jelly. Leave
on ice after set, until ready to serve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Cucumber Jelly</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>STRING BEANS</b></div>

<p>Wax or string beans should be snapped in
small pieces and all strings removed, then washed
and put on to boil in hot salted water. Cook
until tender (generally this requires about forty
minutes), drain and serve in a hot dish with butter,
pepper and salt, or, if preferred, the cream
sauce. Our young cook will have many opportunities
to use her recipe for white sauce with
the spring vegetables, for almost all kinds are
improved when it is added.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PEAS AND LIMA BEANS</b></div>

<p>Peas and Lima beans, after being shelled and
covered with salted boiling water, are cooked until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tender (forty to sixty minutes) and then
served either plain, as directed for the beans, or
with the cream sauce, which, by the way, is better
for such vegetables if thinned with more milk
than when used in other ways.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CAULIFLOWER</b></div>

<p>Cauliflower, after being carefully washed,
should be tied up in a piece of cheese-cloth to
keep the shape, and after soaking for an hour
in cold water, cooked in boiling salted water at
least half an hour. When tender, it should be
carefully lifted to the vegetable dish and the
cream sauce poured around the base. A little
chopped parsley scattered on top the sauce improves
the appearance.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BEETS</b></div>

<p>Young beets have to be washed carefully to
avoid breaking the skin, and have roots and half
an inch of the tops left on while cooking. They
should be kept covered with salted boiling water,
and cooked until tender, allowing at least an hour
for new beets, and possibly even three for old.
When perfectly tender (on being tried by the
prong of a kitchen fork), remove from the fire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
drop into cold water for a moment to cool enough
to slip off the skins, and then slice in a hot dish.
They can be served plain, with butter, pepper
and salt, although our grandmothers preferred
the addition of a few spoonfuls of warm, thick
cream. Many, however, like a little vinegar instead.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>TOMATOES</b></div>

<p>Baked tomatoes are made by taking the fresh
tomatoes, scooping out the centers and mixing
with bread crumbs, seasoning with butter, pepper
and salt, and then refilling the shell, sprinkling a
few crumbs on top. They require about twenty
minutes to bake, and can be served on rounds of
toast, with cream sauce. In winter, however,
canned tomatoes, alternated with layers of buttered
bread, seasoned with butter, pepper and
salt, are nice baked in a dish, with crumbs
browned over the top.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GREEN CORN</b></div>

<p>Green corn "on the cob" must first have the
husks and silk carefully removed and then be
dropped into boiling salted water and kept boiling
(under a cover) for from ten to twenty minutes,
according to the age of the corn. If very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fresh and tender, it will cook quickly, but it
should be served as soon as removed from the
water.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CORN OYSTERS</b></div>

<p>Any corn left from a meal can be grated off
the cob and used for corn oysters. To one cupful
of corn, add half a cup of milk, one beaten
egg, half a teaspoon of salt, and one tablespoon
of melted butter. Into this stir one-half cup of
sifted flour, and bake like pancakes on a hot,
well greased skillet. Be careful to avoid too hot
a fire or they will scorch on the bottom before
cooking through, and they must not be raw in
the middle. It may be necessary to put a little
extra butter in the pan when they are turned,
but they have to be watched carefully all the
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>For the Unexpected Guest</div>


<p>Entertaining can be made easy by some forethought,
and a little girl should be made to
realize that hospitality, of all things, should
be genuine. In the case of expected company it
is well to get whatever is needed in plenty of
time, but the unexpected guest should receive
none the less cordial greeting while the housekeeper
hurriedly reviews her resources in the way
of material available.</p>

<p>One of the most important lessons to teach the
little girl is that of making simple dishes so attractive
that no hesitation need be felt in asking
friends to share the family fare. This is particularly
true in the case of dishes for supper.
They should not require much extra work, but
be quickly prepared and preferably of what one
happens to have in the house. For a light supper
it is desirable to have one hot dish, beside a
warm bread, cold meat, fruit, cake and tea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>
<a href="images/img075-big.jpg"><img src="images/img075.jpg" width="600" height="433" alt="Table Set for an Easter Luncheon" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Table Set for an Easter Luncheon</span>
</div>

<p>If the child has become proficient, she should
be allowed as a special favor to make the baking-powder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
biscuits by herself. Have her use a small
cutter not more than two inches in diameter, as
small biscuits are more appetizing; and be sure
to have them baked to a light brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>POTATO SALAD</b></div>

<p>Potato salad makes a good chief dish for the
unexpected guest and is easily prepared. The
child should be told to select medium-sized potatoes, at
least one for each person and after
scrubbing with a brush to get perfectly clean,
put on with boiling water enough to cover and
boil gently until tender, then drain and set aside
to cool. This can be done at dinner time, when
the fire is hot, and save extra trouble. When
the potatoes are cold the skins can be easily removed,
and the potatoes then cut in thin slices.
Next she should peel and cut in very thin slices
one small onion (unless the family taste prefers
more) and arrange the alternate layers of sliced
potatoes and onions, well seasoned with salt and
pepper, in a pretty salad bowl. It looks attractive,
too, tossed lightly on lettuce leaves arranged
on a small platter. Over the whole then
pour the boiled salad dressing, or the French,
as the family prefer, and when the potato salad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is ready to serve it should be garnished with
sprigs of parsley and slices of hard-boiled egg.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SCALLOPED OYSTERS</b></div>

<p>Scalloped oysters make a fine supper dish on
a cold night, and there are several ways they can
be prepared. The one I like best I will give first.
The child should butter a number of thin slices
of bread and spread on the bottom of a dripping-pan,
laying on next a layer of oysters, with pepper
and salt; then another layer of the thin buttered
bread, another layer of oysters, and the
top finished with a layer of bread, well seasoned.
Over the whole pour the oyster juice and one-half
cupful of milk. This will require from
twenty to twenty-five minutes in a hot oven, when
the bread on top will be toasted crisp. Many
people like scalloped oysters prepared with crackers,
and in that case the rolled cracker-crumbs
are used instead of the bread, but the taste of
the two dishes is different.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAMED OYSTERS</b></div>

<p>Cook one pint of oysters in their own liquor
or in a few spoonsful of salted water until they
curl at the edges. Have ready a thick cream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sauce, stir in the oysters, and cook a few moments
longer. Serve in baskets made by removing
the inside of the light rolls, brushing with
melted butter and browning in the oven. Make
handles from crust, and insert after filling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<a href="images/img078-big.jpg"><img src="images/img078.jpg" width="550" height="370" alt="Creamed Oysters in Baskets" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Creamed Oysters in Baskets</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRIED OYSTERS</b></div>

<p>To fry oysters, select large, choice ones, and
dry in a napkin. Taking one at a time, roll in
cracker crumbs, season with salt and pepper, dip
in beaten egg, and cover thoroughly again with
the rolled cracker. Spread out on a bread board
and allow to stand a little while for this covering
to set, then cook either in a skillet with a small
amount of butter, or in deep fat, until lightly
browned. Lift on to a piece of wrapping paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to drain, but keep hot, and serve garnished with
parsley and sliced lemon.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WELSH RAREBIT</b></div>

<p>This is another good dish for an evening supper.
Crumble half a pound of grated cheese,
and put in a chafing-dish or a double boiler. Season
with half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful
of prepared mustard and a dash of red
pepper. When it begins to melt, stir constantly,
and as soon as it begins to look the least bit
"stringy," pour in slowly a quarter of a cup of
cream and one beaten egg. As this blends, add
a teaspoonful of butter, cook until smooth, and
serve immediately on rounds of hot toast or
square soda crackers.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRITTERS, APPLE AND BANANA</b></div>

<p>Fritters help out nicely, too, for company,
and can be fried in a small quantity of very hot
fat instead of in the deep fat if mother prefers.
Sift one cup of flour, add one-quarter teaspoon
salt, a tablespoon sugar, two-thirds of a cup of
milk, one tablespoonful melted butter, and the
yolk of one egg, beaten light. Stir to a smooth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
batter, add the stiffly beaten white, and lastly
several sour apples, cut in thin slices, or three
bananas, cut a little thicker. Drop by the spoonful
in the smoking hot fat, set where they will
not scorch, and if in a frying pan, turn over as
soon as brown around the edges. Serve with
powdered sugar.</p>

<span class="caption">Tray Arranged for Welsh Rarebit</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MILK TOAST</b></div>

<p>Put on in a double boiler two cups of milk, one
tablespoonful of butter, salt to your own taste,
and allow to come to a boil. Have ready four
squares of nicely browned toast, put in a hot
vegetable dish, pour over the milk, clap on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
cover, and serve at once. Some people like the
milk thickened with a teaspoonful of flour that
has first been moistened with a little cold milk,
but I prefer it without.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Every housekeeper should impress on her young
daughter the importance of keeping on hand a
small quantity of canned goods to provide for
the unexpected guest, and this should include
sardines, salmon, shrimps, lobster, French peas,
olives and orange marmalade. These things will
all keep for months in a cool place, yet are indispensable
in an emergency. The can of
shrimps, opened and placed in cold water for a
little while, will taste as good as the fresh, and
the salmon, with the skin and bones removed, will
be ready on short notice to be served in a number
of ways.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CANNED FISH SALADS</b></div>

<p>For salad, take either shrimps, lobster or salmon,
and after breaking in small pieces, add an
equal amount of celery, season with salt and
moisten with salad dressing.   Serve on lettuce.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAMED CANNED FISH</b></div>

<p>If our small cook wishes to serve a hot dish,
however, in a hurry for company, she can make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to use with her canned fish, the favorite white
sauce. For this she must first melt one tablespoonful
of butter and add to it one tablespoonful
of flour, a quarter teaspoonful of salt, a dash
of pepper, and lastly, after mixing well, one cupful
of milk, stirring all the time until thick. After
boiling two minutes put in the can of lobster,
shrimps or salmon, broken in small pieces, and
allow to boil gently for three minutes more. Then
serve on rounds of buttered toast, garnished with
parsley.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SARDINE CANAPES</b></div>

<p>If only sardines happen to be left in the reserve
stock and yet something hot is needed, let
the mother show the child how to make that
rather unusual dish, sardine canap&eacute;s. After removing
the bones and tails, the sardines should
be rubbed to a paste and mixed with an equal
quantity of chopped hard-boiled eggs, seasoned
with salt and pepper, a teaspoonful of lemon juice
and half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce.
Then she must cut circles of bread, toast or fry
them brown in butter, and spread on the sardine
paste. Send to the table immediately, garnished
with circles of the hard-boiled white of egg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Rice and Macaroni</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BOILED RICE</b></div>

<p>Rice is one of our most nutritious foods, and
it can be served in such a variety of ways it is
one of the first things a child should be shown
how to prepare. The very easiest (and cheapest)
way is to wash and drain a cup of rice and
then sprinkle it slowly into two quarts of boiling
salted water. Without stirring, set it where
it will simmer slowly, and by the time it has
boiled down thick it should be tender enough to
crush with the tongue. If not, add a little more
boiling water and allow to cook a while longer,
but if it is not stirred the grains will be whole
and the rice will not stick to the pan as long as
there is water enough to keep from burning. If
it is to be served plain, with only cream and
sugar, add a teaspoonful of butter and stir
through lightly just before turning out in the
dish for the table and sprinkle a little ground
cinnamon over the top. This makes an easy and
generally very acceptable dessert. It is particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
nice if turned first into cups to mold, and
then served on a small dish with a spoonful of
jelly or some preserve over the top.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CASSEROLE OF RICE</b></div>

<p>Rice cups are made by lining small well-greased
baking-cups with the rice half an inch thick and
filling with any kind of cold meat, chopped fine
and seasoned. A thin layer of the rice is then
spread over the top and the cups baked in a moderate
oven for twenty minutes. By running a
knife around the edge when done they can be
turned out when cooked, and may be served on
hot toast with either warmed-over gravy or tomato
sauce.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>RICE CUPS, (DESSERT)</b></div>

<p>The rice cups will be delicious for dessert, if
instead of using cold meat they are filled with
mince meat or raisins that have lain in cold water
until they have swelled. When baked they are
to be turned out on sauce dishes and served with
a sauce made by creaming one-third cupful of
butter with one cupful of brown sugar, flavoring
with half-teaspoonful vanilla and heating in a
double boiler until hot and creamy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/img086-big.jpg"><img src="images/img086.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="Compote of Rice" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Compote of Rice</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COMPOTE OF RICE</b></div>

<p>Take plain boiled rice, pack lightly in small
cups, and put in a warm place for an hour to
set. Turn out molded, and send to the table garnished
with any kind of rich preserves,&mdash;preferably
such large fruits as peaches, pears or plums.</p>

<p>Rice nicely cooked is often served in place of
a vegetable and eaten with a fork from the dinner
plate like mashed potatoes. It is a good
thing for the little cook to learn all the different
ways of cooking it, as often a small quantity left
from one meal would prove most acceptable for
another, if prepared differently.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRIED RICE</b></div>

<p>The plain boiled rice intended to be served like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a vegetable or for a simple dessert might not all
be used. If a cupful were left it could be cut
in thin slices and browned in butter for breakfast,
or it could be stirred into the soup made
from the left-overs, as described in one of our
former lessons. The little maid must learn to
use all her odds and ends, and a good way to
teach her would be to ask her what she thought
could be prepared from the small quantity of
food left from a meal. While often there might
not be enough for the whole family, there might
be plenty for the few that happened to be home
for the noon luncheon, or perhaps only enough
for the school lunch that after a while gets to
be such a hard thing for mother to fix up "in
a different way."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>RICE PUDDING</b></div>

<p>Rice pudding is one of the first desserts a child
should learn to make, as it is so little trouble and
always a favorite. She should first beat up thoroughly
two eggs; add half a cupful of sugar, two
cupfuls of milk, a little nutmeg, and stir through
two cupfuls of cooked rice. If the rice has been
standing long enough to stiffen, then, after washing
her hands, she will have to work the rice
through the custard with her fingers in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
remove any lumps. A half cupful of raisins or
dried currants stirred in after the pudding is in
the baking-dish will make it just that much nicer.
In baking, leave in the oven until the pudding is
firm, which will show when a silver knife stuck in
the middle comes out clean. A custard is never
baked enough that sticks to the knife and leaves
it milky.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BOILED MACARONI</b></div>

<p>As there are many days, especially in summer,
when macaroni can well take the place of
meat, it is desirable that the small maid be taught
how to prepare it attractively.</p>

<p>The macaroni is first broken in small pieces,
washed and then boiled in salted water until tender&mdash;about
twenty minutes. It can be tested
with a fork. It is very good if simply drained
when cooked, sprinkled with salt and pepper, dotted
with lumps of butter and sent to the table
piping hot.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MACARONI WITH CHEESE</b></div>

<p>Or it can be taken from the boiling water, put
in a colander, rinsed with cold water, then arranged
in a baking dish in alternate layers with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
grated cheese. Over the top pour one cup of hot
milk in which has been stirred a teaspoon of butter
and a beaten egg. This must be baked a
light brown as quickly as possible, and served at
once. It is not so good after it has stood.</p>

<p>If preferred, a cupful of white sauce can be used
instead of the milk and egg.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MACARONI WITH TOMATO</b></div>

<p>For baked macaroni with tomato, have the little
cook put in her baking dish first a layer of
the cooked and rinsed macaroni, then a layer of
tomatoes, either fresh or canned, but well seasoned,
then another layer of macaroni, then one
of tomatoes, and on the top sprinkle rolled bread
crumbs. Scatter tiny lumps of butter all around,
season again, and bake a light brown in a quick
oven.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MACARONI PIE</b></div>

<p>But if she finds that she has a small quantity
of cold meat on hand, beef, veal or chicken, she
can put one layer of that through the middle of
the macaroni, and she will have a surprise for
her family&mdash;delicious, too. This is quite nice for
wash-day dinner when it can be served with baked
potatoes, at little cost of time or trouble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>In a series of cooking lessons of this kind, it
is manifestly impossible to include directions for
preparing all kinds of food, but I have outlined
the work with the idea of teaching the children a
great variety of dishes, believing that their success
with these will stimulate them to try by themselves
recipes found elsewhere.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Baking Cake and Bread</div>


<p>The child who has been assisted in preparing
the various dishes given in our previous cooking
lessons, and who has learned to follow directions,
will now be eager to undertake different kinds of
baking. The mother should impress on the little
student that the first essential to success is
correct measurements, and the second, careful mixing.
For cake baking a graduated tin cup,
marked in quarters and thirds, is almost a necessity,
as different people's ideas vary so as to
what constitutes a quarter or a third. If the
cup is at hand, however, and is used in taking
all the measurements, there can be no mistake.
And a cupful means a level cupful, not heaping;
a teaspoonful a level spoonful, not a rounded
one, unless so specified.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BAKING PREPARATIONS</b></div>

<p>Before beginning the work, the child should
read over her recipe and lay out all ingredients<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
needed. She should have the mixing bowl on the
table with the mixing spoon, the teaspoon and
tablespoon for measurements, and the measuring
cup. The cake pan, wiped off, warmed and
greased lightly with lard, is next set aside, ready
for use.</p>

<p>Then the fire must be in good condition. If
a gas stove is used it will take only a few moments
to heat the oven properly, but if wood or
coal is the fuel, the mother must show the child
how to prepare the fire, so as to have the oven
the right temperature and on time. The old way
of having it as hot as one can stand the hand
while counting twenty, is a fair test.</p>

<p>As small cakes bake more evenly and quickly
for the inexperienced cook, it is a good idea to
let the child put her cake dough in muffin tins.
A mixture that might fall and seem a failure if
put in a loaf and not properly baked, will often
come up very nicely in gem pans; and, besides,
the small cakes appeal more to the childish fancy.
A nice one-egg cake is made as follows:</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>TEA CAKES</b></div>

<p>One-third of a cup of butter, one cup of sugar,
one egg, one cup of milk, two cups of sifted flour,
two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
teaspoonful of vanilla, and half a cup of currants.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DIRECTIONS FOR MIXING</b></div>

<p>First the child should measure her flour while
her cup is dry, and adding the baking-powder,
sift it on to a paper or in an extra bowl, and set
it aside, ready for use. Next she can measure
the even cupful of sugar into the mixing bowl,
add an even one-third cupful of butter, and rub
together to a creamy mass. If the butter has
been standing a while in the kitchen, it will be
warm enough to work up nicely. Then she must
separate the egg, beating the white stiff and the
yolk until it is foaming. Adding the beaten yolk
to the butter and sugar, she again stirs thoroughly,
and then begins adding&mdash;a little at a time&mdash;first
the milk and then the sifted flour, stirring
evenly all the while. Put in the vanilla, the stiffly
beaten white of egg, with the currants, mixing
as little as possible, and pour out into the
greased gem pans. If the oven is right, the baking
will take from fifteen to twenty minutes, but
if the oven seems too hot, leave the door slightly
open for about five minutes. An old-fashioned
way of finding out when the cakes are well baked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is to try with a new wooden toothpick. If it
comes out clean and dry the cakes are done.</p>

<p>On removing from the oven, loosen around the
bottom edge (the cakes should have shrunk from
the sides), and turn on to a bread board. When
cold, they can be iced with the following simple
icing:</p>

<span class="caption">Tea Cakes Baked in Heart Shape</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WHITE ICING UNCOOKED</b></div>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls milk or cream, enough confectioner's
sugar to make a thick paste and half
dozen drops of vanilla. In spreading, if the icing
does not go on as smoothly as desired the silver
knife used for spreading can occasionally be
dipped in a glass of cold water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COCOA ICING</b></div>

<p>When the child has followed this recipe several
times successfully, she can then try baking
it in two cake tins. When done and cool, she
can put the layers together with the same icing,
to which, by adding two teaspoonfuls of cocoa,
she will have a nice chocolate filling. When the
cocoa is used, she will need a trifle more milk or
cream.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GINGER COOKIES</b></div>

<p>After the child has fully mastered this recipe,
let her next try some ginger cookies. To a half
a cupful of molasses, one teaspoonful of soda,
half a cupful sour milk, half a cupful of sugar,
and one-third cupful of melted butter add one
well-beaten egg, three cupfuls of flour, with one
tablespoonful of ginger. This will make a thick
mass which is to be turned out as soft as can be
handled, half at a time, on a well-floured bread
board. The child must then flour her rolling-pin
to keep it from sticking, and roll as thin as
desired. She should thoroughly grease the dripping
pan and then cut out her cookies and lift
carefully into place, one just touching another.
The oven should be quite hot for these as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
ought to bake quickly; and on removing from
the oven, they should stand a moment in the pan
before being lifted on to a plate.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SPICE CAKE</b></div>

<p>For an inexpensive spice cake, take one-half
cup of butter, one cup of sugar, one egg, (white
beaten separately), one and one-half cups of flour,
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, half a cup
of milk, one-quarter teaspoonful ground cloves,
one-quarter teaspoonful nutmeg, one teaspoonful
cinnamon, half a teaspoonful vanilla. Cream the
butter and sugar, add yolk of egg and beat very
light. Sift flour and baking powder, and stir
in alternately with the milk. Add spice and flavoring
next, then the stiff white, and bake either
in gem pans or in a loaf. Half a cupful of
seeded raisins or currants will be an improvement.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WARM GINGERBREAD</b></div>

<p>Stir together half a cup of molasses, half a
cup of brown sugar, one teaspoonful of soda, one
beaten egg, two tablespoons melted butter, half
a cup of milk, two cups of flour, one tablespoonful
of ginger, teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-quarter
teaspoonful cloves, and a little nutmeg. Mix<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in the order given, pour in greased shallow pan,
and bake from fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When the little cook has learned to follow the
foregoing recipes so that she understands all the
details of mixing and is able to make nice light
cakes, let her some time try the following, which
by using the whites for a delicate cake and the
yolks for a gold cake, will give her two choice
cakes without extra expense. After bringing to
the table, when ready to begin, the sugar can,
the butter jar, the egg dish, the milk, the vanilla
and the baking powder, so that everything will be
convenient, and having well greased a pan for
the gold cake (which will be baked in a loaf) and
the two jelly tins for the white cake, she can
then separate three eggs, and to the three yolks
add one whole egg. On account of the baking
it is best to make the white cake first, and then
it can be iced and the dishes cleaned away while
the loaf cake bakes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WHITE CAKE</b></div>

<p>One even half cupful of butter and an even
cupful of sugar, creamed until it is light and
foamy.   To one and one-half cupfuls of flour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
add two level teaspoonfuls baking-powder, and
sift several times. Then into the creamed butter
and sugar pour one-half cupful milk, alternately,
a little at a time, with the flour. Before
putting in the last of the flour, stir extra
well, then put in one teaspoonful vanilla and the
stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, mix as little
as possible, to stir through, and then add the
last of the flour. Bake either in a loaf or in two
layer tins. The layers can be put together when
cold with either the icing already given or this
chocolate frosting:</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHOCOLATE ICING</b></div>

<p>To one cup of granulated sugar add one-third
cup of boiling water, and stir to dissolve until
it begins to boil, but no longer. Cook until it
hairs from a spoon, then pour slowly on the stiff
white of an egg, beating steadily. When the
candy is well mixed through the egg, add two
squares of chocolate, grated, and continue beating
until cool and thick enough to spread. If
the candy happens to be taken off too soon, the
icing will not get thick, and in that event it can
be made the right consistency by the addition of
a little confectioner's sugar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BOILED ICING</b></div>

<p>For the plain white boiled icing, simply omit
the chocolate from the foregoing recipe, and
flavor as desired.</p>

<p>After the two white layers have been put into
the oven, if she will be very careful not to forget
them, our little maid can go at her loaf cake.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GOLD CAKE</b></div>

<p>To one cupful of sugar, and a rounded tablespoonful
of butter rubbed creamy, she can stir
in the four yolks and one whole egg beaten together
as light as the proverbial feather. Then
after sifting one and one-half cupfuls of flour
with two level teaspoonfuls baking-powder in a
separate bowl, she can add, a little at a time,
one-half cupful of milk and the flour in the same
way that she did in mixing her white cake.
Flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla, or lemon, if
preferred.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CITRON CAKE</b></div>

<p>If citron is liked, a quarter-cupful, cut very
thin, and lightly floured, can be stirred through
the batter made for the gold cake, the last thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
This cake will bake better if put in a pan having
a funnel opening in the center. The oven should
be a little cooler for a loaf cake, and it should
bake from forty to forty-five minutes. When
done, it will shrink slightly from the sides of the
pan and should be a delicate brown. The best
way to avoid the possibility of sticking, is to first
cut a piece of paper to fit the bottom of the pan
and grease it thoroughly. On removing from
the oven, the loaf cake should stand a few moments
and then be turned out on the bread board.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>NUT CAKE</b></div>

<p>If desired, when the loaf is cool, it can be iced
also, with a white icing, and it will look attractive
if a few nut meats are scattered over the top before
the icing hardens. If nuts are liked, a few
can be stirred through the cake instead of the
citron and thus by using either (or neither) our
small cook can make three different cakes with
the same recipe.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE</b></div>

<p>A delicious chocolate cake, sometimes called
Devil's Food, is made as follows: cream three-quarters
of a cup of butter with one cup of sugar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and add the beaten yolks of two eggs. Sift several
times one and one-half cups of flour with two
scant teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and stir in,
alternating with half a cup of milk. Flavor with
three tablespoonfuls of cocoa (or two squares of
unsweetened chocolate, grated), and half a teaspoonful
of vanilla, and lastly add the two whites,
beaten stiff. Bake in two layers, and put together
with white icing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/img103-big.jpg"><img src="images/img103.jpg" width="600" height="394" alt="Afternoon Tea for Two" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Afternoon Tea for Two</span>
</div>

<p>Any child with care and a little practice should
be able to bake successfully any of the recipes
given. They are not expensive, and yet if properly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
put together will make cake light and nice
enough to offer any guest. The first, of course,
is a trifle cheaper, but the others will give a good
variety for any company, and when she has
learned to make them so they turn out well every
time, she will have made a great advance in her
cooking lessons. Then by simply changing her
icing she can have as many different kinds as the
family desire.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BREAD</b></div>

<p>Home-made bread is one thing that everybody
likes, and while it takes time and patience, it is
not really hard to make. One little girl I knew
took pride in making all the bread for a family of
four, and it was fine, too. The recipe here given
will make three large loaves, so if you prefer, you
can use only half at first, until sure that you have
learned to do it properly. Take three quarts of
sifted flour, one even iron kitchen spoonful of salt,
a rounded one of sugar, and one, also rounded, of
lard melted in one cup of warm water&mdash;not hot.
Dissolve one fresh compressed yeast cake in one
cup of warm water, and add that, with two more
cups of warm water. Mix this all well together,
using your big spoon. When as smooth as you
can get it that way, turn out on a floured board,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and knead for fifteen or twenty minutes. Then
set it away where it will not get chilled, and leave
it to rise for from four to six hours, when it will
be about double its original size. Then turn out
on your bread board again, cut it in three parts,
roll into nice smooth loaves, without more kneading,
put in buttered bread tins, leave again in a
warm place for about two hours, then bake in a
moderate oven until a pretty brown. When done,
go lightly over the hard crust with a small white
cloth dipped in cold water, roll in a fresh tea towel
and allow to cool before cutting. If you wish, you
can start your bread and give the first kneading
at night, then cover and leave until morning.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LIGHT BISCUIT</b></div>

<p>For light biscuit, take one of the three parts cut
for the bread, twist off little pieces the size of an
egg, roll smooth without working, wet over the
top with melted butter or milk, let rise to double
their size, and bake in a hot oven from fifteen to
twenty minutes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Desserts Good in Summer</div>


<p>For the hot days of summer, I know the mothers
and little cooks will be deeply interested in cold
desserts of all kinds&mdash;dishes that can be made
early in the morning and set away, as well as various
frozen dainties. It is well to enjoy the delicious
fruits and melons in their season (and really
nothing finishes off a dinner better after a close,
warm day), but still we all want to know how to
make light puddings and jellies for a change.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FLOATING ISLAND</b></div>

<p>Floating island is a nice dessert, easily made by
any child, with reasonable care. For six persons,
have her take three even cupfuls of milk and one-fourth
teaspoonful salt, and put on to heat in a
double kettle. Then beat up the yolks of three
eggs, add one-half cupful sugar, one-half teaspoonful
vanilla, and pour in them slowly the hot
milk, stirring all the time. Return to the double
boiler and continue to stir until it thickens and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
gets creamy, coating the spoon. Do not allow to
boil, or it will curdle.   Cover and set aside to cool.</p>

<p>Next the whites should be beaten up very stiff,
and sweetened with two tablespoonfuls of powdered
sugar. Have a pan filled with boiling hot
water&mdash;but not bubbling&mdash;and into this drop the
whites in heaping big spoonfuls. After standing
a few moments they will puff up very light. While
they are cooking, pour the custard in a glass dish,
then lift the whites with a skimmer, allow to drain
and dot them over the top. Made in this way, the
meringue tastes much better than when served uncooked.
A half-teaspoonful of currant jelly on
top of each "island" makes the dessert even more
inviting, and it looks particularly nice when served
in individual glass dishes or sherbet cups.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Gelatin forms the basis for many delicious, inexpensive
puddings. It is well for the housewife
to examine the recipes coming with the different
brands, for while some boxes will make only one
quart of jelly, others at the same price will make
two, and therefore cost only half as much.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LEMON JELLY</b></div>

<p>For plain lemon jelly, the mother will instruct
the child to soak two rounded tablespoonfuls of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
granulated gelatin in one-third cupful of cold water
for fifteen minutes. Then add two cupfuls of
boiling water, one cupful sugar, and the strained
juice of two lemons. Pour in a shallow mold to
set and when ready to send to the table turn onto
a small platter and garnish with whipped cream,
or serve with the custard used for floating island.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/img108-big.jpg"><img src="images/img108.jpg" width="600" height="420" alt="Fruit Jelly with Whipped Cream" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fruit Jelly with Whipped Cream</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRUIT JELLY</b></div>

<p>For a fruit jelly in winter, line the bottom of
the mold or individual cups with pieces of banana,
orange, or preserved cherries, fill up with the liquid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
lemon jelly and set away to harden. In berry season,
however, flavor the gelatin with half a cupful
of the pure berry juice strained (instead of using
lemon), and pour into cups half filled with fine,
whole berries. This is best served with whipped
cream, one large berry decorating the top of each
cup.</p>

<p>These jellies have to be set in a very cold
place to make them firm, and it is often advisable
in warm weather, if they cannot be put on ice, to
make them, the night before they are needed, then
put them in the coolest place possible.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WHIPPED CREAM</b></div>

<p>Whipped cream is called for with so many
dishes, that every little girl should learn how to
prepare it. In the first place the cream must be
very thick and very cold. In the cities a special
cream is usually delivered if ordered for whipping;
and I believe it is a day older than the other kind.
But if thick enough and cold, there is no trick at
all about making it stiff in a very few moments.
Have the child take a deep bowl or small stone
butter jar, rinse it in cold water until chilled, then
wipe and pour in one-half pint of cream. Taking
a Dover egg-beater, also thoroughly cold, let her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
whip steadily and not too fast until thick as the
stiff white of an egg. Taking out the beater, next
add half a cupful of confectioners' sugar, half a
teaspoonful of vanilla, stir thoroughly and set
away on the ice until needed. It is best when
freshly made.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>NUTS</b></div>

<p>Nuts are used so much nowadays, in all kinds
of cookery, that we find them in the most unexpected
places. When chopped, they are mixed
with cottage cheese for sandwiches, stirred into
all kinds of salads, put into cake batter, and all
kinds of icings; and when left in unbroken halves,
used to garnish many gelatine puddings and
whipped-cream desserts.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But when the very hottest days come, we all
like the good things that come from the ice-cream
freezer. The best up-to-date freezers do their
work very quickly, the great secret being to have
the ice broken up in very fine pieces or crushed in
a strong bag. A good rule to follow for mixing
with salt is as follows:</p>

<p>For ice-creams, three parts ice to one part salt.</p>

<p>For frapp&eacute;s, two parts ice to one part salt.</p>

<p>For mousses, etc., equal parts ice and salt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Then be sure to get the top on your can tightly,
and when you are ready to remove it be careful to
first brush aside all ice and salt, so not one particle
can possibly get into the freezer. Nothing
marks the amateur more than salt in the ice-cream.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRENCH ICE-CREAM</b></div>

<p>A delicious French ice-cream has for its foundation
a custard made by beating up first the yolks
of three eggs very light, adding a pinch of salt,
one cupful sugar and two cupfuls of milk. Cook
this in a double boiler until it coats the spoon, but
do not allow to boil or it will curdle. Cool, flavor
with a teaspoonful of rich vanilla, add one pint
of cream and freeze.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM</b></div>

<p>For a rich chocolate ice-cream, make like the
foregoing, only add to the custard before it cools
two ounces of grated, unsweetened chocolate which
has been set in a pan of hot water long enough to
allow it to melt. This takes but a few moments,
however.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRUIT ICE</b></div>

<p>For a refreshing fruit ice, have our little maid
prepare the juice of three oranges, three lemons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and one pint of either strawberries or red raspberries.
After straining through a coarse strainer,
she must add three cupfuls of sugar, three cupfuls
of cold water and the stiffly beaten whites of two
eggs. This does not need to be frozen quite so
hard as the ice-cream.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>STRAWBERRY MOUSSE</b></div>

<p>In strawberry season, particularly on a farm
where there is an abundance of rich cream and
luscious fruit, the finest kind of a frozen dessert is
made by adding to a pint of thick unflavored
cream, whipped as directed, two cupfuls of crushed
berries and two cupfuls of sugar. The berries and
sugar, well mixed, should be folded carefully into
the cream and pressed in a mold. The cracks
must be filled with butter or lard to prevent the
salt water leaking in, and the mold packed closely
in salt and ice and left for four hours. Remember
it is not frozen in the freezer by turning. When
ready to unmold, wring a cloth out of boiling water
and lay around the can for a moment, after
loosening where possible with a thin-bladed knife.
Turn on to a platter and send to the table to be
cut in slices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LEMON ICE</b></div>

<p>For a plain lemon ice, take the grated rind of
one lemon, and the juice of three, a cupful and a
half of sugar, four cupfuls of water, and the
stiffly beaten whites of two eggs. Freeze, but
not too hard.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CITRON CUSTARD</b></div>

<p>Citron custard is good summer or winter, served
hot or cold. The child should first beat up very
light two eggs, then add a pinch of salt, one-third
cupful of sugar, two cupfuls of milk, and a sprinkle
of nutmeg. Next she must line a baking-dish
or individual cups with thin slices of citron, then
pour in the custard and bake, after setting her
dish or cups in a pan of boiling water. If a few
small nails are scattered over the bottom of the
water-pan, so the pudding cups do not touch, but
are surrounded by water, the custard will cook
more evenly. Leave in the oven about twenty minutes,
but test before taking out by inserting in the
middle the blade of a silver knife. When thoroughly
done the blade will come out clean instead
of coated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/img114-big.jpg"><img src="images/img114.jpg" width="600" height="310" alt="Cornstarch Pudding, Individual Moulds" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Cornstarch Pudding, Individual Moulds</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CORNSTARCH PUDDING</b></div>

<p>Cornstarch pudding is an old favorite, too,
either hot or cold. First mix four level tablespoonfuls
of cornstarch with three tablespoonfuls
of sugar, and beat up light one egg. Then scald
two cupfuls of milk, after pouring a few spoonfuls
on the cornstarch in order to thoroughly wet it.
When the milk is hot, add the moistened cornstarch
and sugar, the beaten egg, and flavoring
to taste, stirring constantly until thick. Then
allow to cook gently for ten minutes at least. A
double boiler is best for all such puddings, as it
prevents all possibility of scorching, but it takes
longer. One delicious way of serving this otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ordinary dish is to cut a few thin peelings
from a lemon (just the yellow part), cook with
the milk till a delicate flavor is imparted, and then
remove. When the pudding is done, pour in a
mold and let set. Then serve with whipped cream
flavored with vanilla. The combination of the
two flavorings is very agreeable.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>RAISIN TAPIOCA</b></div>

<p>Tapioca is a thing every child should learn to
use, as it is capable of so many variations. For
the simplest pudding, have her first cover three-quarters
of a cup of tapioca, (or sago, either),
with one cupful of cold water and allow to soak
at least an hour. Then add three cupfuls of boiling
water, one-half teaspoonful salt, the flavoring
and sugar to taste, and boil until transparent.
If the family like lemon, let her add the
strained juice and grated rind of one lemon and
one-half cupful of sugar. Or, she can use a level
cupful of raisins, the juice and grated rind of
half a lemon and cupful of sugar. (The raisins
should be seeded, of course.)</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>APPLE TAPIOCA</b></div>

<p>Or still another way is to boil the tapioca,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sweetened but not flavored, for about fifteen minutes,
then pour into a baking-dish half filled with
sliced apples and flavored with nutmeg. This
must be baked until the apples are tender.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>TAPIOCA CUSTARD</b></div>

<p>Probably the most common way, though, of
making tapioca pudding is by taking half the
recipe given and after boiling fifteen minutes,
(without flavoring or sugar), adding to it two
cupfuls of milk, two well-beaten eggs, one-half
teaspoonful vanilla, and half a cupful of sugar,
then baking until the custard begins to brown on
top. All these desserts are to be served with
cream, plain or whipped, which adds to the appearance
as well as taste.</p>

<p>There are several brands of granulated tapioca
on the market, and they are convenient if one is
in a hurry, but they are more expensive than the
ordinary kind, and I have found that the directions
on the box seldom allow sufficient time to
boil, and also that the pouring on of boiling
water suggested is apt to result in the powdered
tapioca forming lumps which require an extra
amount of cooking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE</b></div>

<p>A favorite hot sauce for puddings, or to be
served separately with vanilla ice-cream, is made
by melting one square of unsweetened chocolate,
adding a teaspoonful of butter, one-third of a cup
of water, one cup of sugar, and a few drops of
vanilla. Cook for five minutes, and keep hot until
needed. Two tablespoonfuls of cocoa can be used
if preferred.</p>

<p>My little cooks should now have become experienced
enough that if they saw a recipe they
thought they would like in some newspaper or
magazine they could go ahead and try it by themselves.
It might be well for mother to glance it
over first and see if it looks all right, and then if
she said "Yes," proceed with it. But whatever
they try, they should remember to be sure they
put in every ingredient according to directions,
and then cook to the queen's taste!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Thanksgiving Dinner</div>


<p>All children are deeply interested in preparations
for company, and in the getting ready for
the Thanksgiving dinner every mother will find
good opportunity to teach her little daughter
many valuable lessons. There is so much to be
thought of at this time and so much to be done
that the wise woman will take the child into consultation,
and by freely discussing plans get help
and at the same time train her into the right way
to prepare for guests.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>THANKSGIVING MENU</b></div>

<p>In the first place, talk over with her and decide
about the number to be entertained, and then settle
on the menu. Get her to express her opinions,
and if they are good let her see that you approve
them by following her suggestions. If they
are not good point out wherein they are at fault,
and after deciding what dishes are to be served,
show her how to write out the bill of fare in
proper form. This should then be hung up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the kitchen for reference, as otherwise it would be
an easy matter to overlook something or make a
mistake. If, for instance, a simple dinner of the
usual good things is desired, it should be written
out in this way&mdash;and the child herself can do the
writing:</p>


<div class='center'><br />DINNER<br />

<br />
<i>Consomm&eacute;</i><br />
<br />
<i>Roast Turkey, with Dressing</i><br />
<br />
<i>Cranberry Sauce</i>   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <i>Pickles</i>   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <i>Celery</i><br />
<br />
<i>Mashed Potatoes</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Creamed Onions</i><br />
<br />
<i>Mince Pie</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <i>Cream Cheese</i><br />
<br />
<i>Coffee</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <i>Nuts</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Raisins</i><br /></div>



<div class='center'><br /><b>MARKETING</b></div>

<p>The day before let the child help in the marketing.
As she has already been shown how to
make consomm&eacute;, she can now be allowed to do it
by herself, and set it away to be heated up when
needed. When you go to buy the turkey, vegetables
and fruits, show her the right kind to select.
Explain that the celery should be crisp and
white, not wilted and discolored; the cranberries
hard and red, not soft and brown in spots; the
oranges solid and heavy, not pithy and light.</p>

<p>Have her consult the list made before starting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
out, to be sure she gets everything needed before
beginning her cooking.</p>

<span class="caption">A Dinner Table, with Fruit Centerpiece, and Nuts in Individual Baskets</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DRESSING THE TURKEY</b></div>

<p>Returning home, as soon as the turkey is delivered
show her how to dress it. This is always
an interesting process, and while few mothers like
to see their girls really do this work, they ought
to explain it fully. After taking out the pinfeathers
and singeing, the skin should be carefully
washed with warm water, soap and a small
clean cloth, for so much dust adheres to the flesh
of poultry that in no other way can it be removed.
As fowls are usually drawn at the market, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
take out the giblets, tear away the lights, rinse
thoroughly the inside and then sprinkle with salt.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MOIST STUFFING</b></div>

<p>The little cook herself can be allowed to make
the stuffing. To each loaf of stale bread, broken
in small pieces, add salt and pepper to taste, two
tablespoonfuls of butter, half-teaspoonful of
ground sage and boiling water enough to slightly
moisten.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DRY STUFFING</b></div>

<p>For dry dressing, crumble the bread, omit the
water, but use four tablespoonfuls of melted butter.
Pack in the turkey very loosely. Some people
like this seasoned with thyme, while others
prefer onion.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>OYSTER STUFFING</b></div>

<p>Or if oyster dressing is preferred, omit sage
and add instead one pint of oysters, using the
liquor to dampen the bread. Pack lightly in the
turkey, sew up the opening with white thread and
set away in a cool place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CRANBERRY SAUCE</b></div>

<p>Taking the cranberries next, the child can sort
them over, wash and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: word 'on' removed from text. Original read: 'put on in'">put in</ins> a granite kettle,
allowing half a cupful of water and two cupfuls
of sugar to each quart of berries. Place over a
slow fire, and after boiling fifteen or twenty minutes,
stirring only enough to keep from burning,
remove and set away until cool enough to pour
in a glass dish. Berries cooked this way will keep
their shape, be transparent and a bright, pretty
red.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MINCE MEAT</b></div>

<p>The mince-meat takes some time to prepare,
and is much better if made a week or two beforehand
and allowed to stand in a tightly covered
jar. Our small cook can help get ready the raisins,
currants, citron, orange peel, and apples
while the beef is boiling, and then will be delighted
to do the chopping. To half a pound of lean beef,
cooked until well done and chopped fine, add half
a pound of chopped suet and one pound of
chopped tart apples, prepared separately. To
this put half a pound of currants, cleaned and
dried, half a pound of seeded raisins, half a pound
of citron, cut in small pieces, two cupfuls of light-brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sugar, an even teaspoonful salt, half a teaspoonful
each of ground cloves and allspice, one
teaspoonful cinnamon, one-fourth teaspoonful
grated nutmeg, one tablespoonful of finely broken
dried orange peel, juice of one lemon, one pint of
boiled cider. Boil slowly for an hour, add, if desired,
one-half cupful of brandy, and then pack
away in a crock in a cool place. This recipe, with
full directions for mixing, should then be written
out in the small cook-book, for although it may
not be needed again for a long time, it will be
ready for reference at any moment, ready for use
without any doubt or trouble&mdash;and "the kind
that mother used to make." Mince-meat is so fascinating,
too, on account of all the good things
that go into it, that scarcely anyone that ever
made it right once can fail thereafter.</p>

<p>Every girl should know how to make good pie
crust, and as it is principally a matter of having
the ingredients chilled from the ice-box, almost
anyone can be successful by taking a little care.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
<img src="images/img124.jpg" width="397" height="600" alt="Making Pies" title="" />
<span class="caption">Making Pies</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PLAIN PASTRY</b></div>

<p>Sift one and one-half cupfuls of flour with one-half
teaspoonful salt. Chop through this until
like meal a half-cupful of chilled lard. Add just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
enough ice-water to make a stiff dough, and turn
out with as little handling as possible on a floured
bread-board. Sprinkle on flour enough to keep
from sticking to rolling-pin, and dividing into sections,
roll to fit the size of the pie-pan. (Perforated
tins are preferable.) Add filling, put on
thinly-rolled top crust, with a few openings in
center to emit steam, and bake about half an
hour, after pressing the edges thoroughly together
to keep in all juice. If desired shorter,
three-quarters of a cupful of lard can be used,
but the dough must be kept thoroughly chilled,
and it is best made in a cold room.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SETTING THE TABLE</b></div>

<p>Then, on Thursday morning begin the dinner
in plenty of time, so there will be no hurry or confusion
at the last moment. The table can be set
early, the little maid being shown the silver required.
At the right of each plate put the knife,
soup spoon and necessary teaspoons; at the left
the forks, three if a salad is served. The glass
for water is placed to the right of the center, in
line with the knife, and the napkin either directly
in the center on the service-plate or to the left of
the forks. If no flowers are available for table
decorations, pile the fruit up attractively for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
centerpiece, using the small dishes of nuts and
raisins at each end to balance.</p>

<p>The vegetables next should be prepared. Trim
off the long green ends of the celery and the discolored
outside stalks, (which will make a nice
cream of celery soup next day), and then instead
of separating the remaining stalks, cut through
the whole bunches into quarter sections or smaller.
In this way each person gets part of the inside
tender heart, and the celery is more attractive.</p>

<p>When dinner is all ready, if there is no maid
to help, the easiest way is to have the soup
served and placed on the table just before calling
out the guests. Then, when ready for the next
course, our little cook can remove the soup plates,
taking from the right side of each person, and
bring on the dinner. When that is over, she
must remove all the dishes before each one, clear
the table of everything but the water glasses and
the decorations, brush the cloth with a folded
napkin and a plate to catch the crumbs, and
lastly bring in the dessert. Every family has its
own way as regards details, but a mother can
very quickly get a child into the habit of being
neat, careful and quiet about handling dishes.
And she must always remember to proffer food
on a tray, at the left.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Christmas Dinner Party</div>


<p>Our little cook, after her experience at Thanksgiving,
will probably be most eager to take part
in the preparations for the Christmas dinner.
Consult her now, as before; tell her all your ideas,
get her suggestions, and then make all plans at
least a week beforehand. Holidays should be
holidays for the hostess as well as the guest, and
can be made so by the choice of a dinner that is
good and at the same time easily prepared. The
suggested menu following will be found attractive
enough for any party, and at the same time
it is neither expensive nor very difficult to get
ready.</p>

<p>Let the little girl again make out the bill of
fare and hang up in the kitchen for reference,
make out her list for market and grocery, and
help in the selection of the goose, the vegetables
and the fruits. Thus she will learn the best kinds
to buy and what they cost, and incidentally
mother and daughter can have a regular little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
lark out of the expedition and become better
chums than in almost any other way.</p>


<div class='center'><br />CHRISTMAS MENU<br />

<span class='small'>MENU FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER</span><br />

<br />
<i>Raw Oysters</i>, <i>Horseradish</i><br />
<br />
<i>Roast Goose</i>    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Apple Sauce</i>    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <i>Celery</i><br />
<br />
<i>Mashed Potatoes</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Lima Beans</i><br />
<br />
<i>Tomato Jelly Salad</i><br />
<br />
<i>Plum Pudding</i><br />
<br />
<i>Fruit</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Nuts</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Raisins</i><br />
<br />
<i>Coffee</i><br />
</div>

<p>The first dish to make, strange to say, is the
last one on the list, and the plum pudding is better
if made several weeks before it is needed, and
then simply steamed up again for a couple of
hours just before serving. A fine old recipe that
had been in a friend's family for years, was once
given me, but as it filled six molds I reduced it to
the following proportions, which is ample for a
mold large enough for eight people:</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PLUM PUDDING</b></div>

<p>One-half cupful butter, three-quarters cupful
sugar, one-quarter pound suet, two and one-half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
cupfuls flour, one-half pound seeded raisins, one-half
pound currants, one ounce citron, three eggs
yolks and whites (beaten separately), one-half
cupful milk, one-quarter cupful almonds (blanched
and chopped fine), one-quarter cupful brandy (or
boiled cider if preferred), one-half teaspoonful
cloves, one-quarter teaspoonful nutmeg, one teaspoonful
cinnamon.</p>

<p>After getting all her ingredients out on the
table and ready, the little cook should cream her
butter and sugar, beat in yolks, add milk, and
then stir in the flour alternately with the stiff
whites. Then put in the brandy and spice, and
last of all the fruit and nuts, dredged with a little
flour. This should be well stirred, and then
packed in a thoroughly greased covered mold
and steamed for four hours.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>HARD SAUCE</b></div>

<p>Two kinds of sauce are nice for this pudding,
served together. A hard sauce is made by creaming
one-half cupful of butter in one cupful of
fine sugar, adding half teaspoonful of brandy or
vanilla and one teaspoonful cream and stirring
until light and creamy. It can be set in a bowl
of hot water at first to help make the butter
cream, but after being beaten light should be set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in the cold to harden. A teaspoonful of this hard
sauce is served on each portion of the pudding.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>HOT SAUCE</b></div>

<p>The following hot sauce is poured around:
one-quarter cupful butter, one cupful sugar, one
teaspoonful flour. Mix flour and sugar, add
butter and one cupful cold water, and stir until
it boils and thickens.   Flavor with nutmeg.</p>

<p>The day before Christmas repeat the lesson in
dressing a fowl, and let her make the stuffing
from the recipe used before, only this time she
should omit the sage or oysters and season with
a small onion chopped fine.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>APPLE SAUCE</b></div>

<p>For the accompanying apple sauce, let her
peel and quarter half a dozen tart apples, put on
to cook in a cup of cold water, and when tender
press through a colander, sweeten to taste, and
then put in a pretty glass dish and grate nutmeg
over the top. This should then be covered
and set away until ready to be carried to the
table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL</b></div>

<p>As we intended to have as little work as possible
about this particular dinner, I have suggested
raw oysters for the first course instead of a soup.
Serve on the half-shell if you can get them that
way, putting a little chopped ice on each plate to
hold the shells in place, giving four or five oysters
to each person, and putting one empty shell
in the center to hold the horseradish or slice of
lemon. If the oysters are opened at the market
all you have to do is to see that they are kept on
ice until served.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>TOMATO JELLY SALAD</b></div>

<p>For the tomato jelly salad, first boil together
until very tender one quart can of tomatoes, one
small sliced onion, six cloves, one-half cupful
chopped celery. Strain through a jelly bag, season
with salt and pepper, and add gelatin which
has been dissolving in a few spoonfuls of cold
water. As different brands vary, however, study
the directions on the box in order to get the right
amount to stiffen one quart of jelly.</p>

<p>If the gelatin does not thoroughly melt with
the warm tomato juice, set over the fire for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
moments, and then pour into small molds (wine
glasses or after-dinner coffee cups will serve
nicely), and set away to harden over night. Next
morning fix the required number of salad dishes
with lettuce leaves or tender cabbage cut in
strings, and turn out carefully the molded tomato
jelly. Over the top of each drop a large spoonful
of thick boiled dressing.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS</b></div>

<p>A pretty idea for a Christmas table is to carry
out as fully as possible a color scheme of red and
green. The centerpiece, of course, should be of
holly, and a novel one it will be if large beautiful
pieces are put in the upper part of a double boiler
and set out to freeze. I did this once by accident,
and when I went for my holly there it was&mdash;imbedded
in a solid block of ice. The shape
of the oat-meal kettle, like a flowerpot, allowed
the ice to turn out easily, and it could then be
set on a plate and trimmed around the bottom
with the holly leaves. A couple of bolts of red
baby ribbon will be enough for streamers from
the chandelier to each plate, at which should be
a pretty piece of the holly&mdash;or better still, if you
can get them, three or four red carnations for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
each lady, and one for the buttonhole of each
gentleman.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COLOR SCHEME</b></div>

<p>To carry out this color plan, the oysters should
be served with catsup and garnished with parsley,
the tomato jelly be turned out on lettuce,
the plum pudding (ablaze with a spoonful of alcohol)
decorated with holly, and the candy&mdash;red
and white peppermint wafers&mdash;tied with green
baby ribbon.</p>

<p>If the details of preparing the dinner have
been followed out as I have suggested, and everything
possible done the day before, on Christmas
morning there will be little to do: the goose to
put into the oven and roast, the potatoes to mash
and the beans to dress, the plum pudding to heat
up, the sauce to prepare, with the gravy and
the coffee to make at the last moment. Our small
cook of course has the celery cleaned preparatory
to cutting up, and the nuts all cracked, and she
can tie up the candy and assist with the decorations.
Having helped set the table for the
Thanksgiving party, she will feel perfectly competent
to undertake the arrangement now, alone,
and you, Mother, can say, "You have gotten
along with everything so nicely, and remembered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
so well, I will let you put on the dishes and silver
all by yourself." Then when she reports
that all is ready, look over the work yourself and
see that it is all right. Possibly she will have
misplaced some pieces, forgotten others, but if
you point out the errors and have her remedy
the mistakes herself, she will likely remember next
time and make her table a well-appointed one.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Delicious Home-Made Candies</div>


<p>All children love to make candy, and the home-made
kinds are much purer and better&mdash;besides
being much cheaper&mdash;than those usually sold at
the small confectionery stores. Every mother
will do well to help her little daughter master
this branch of cookery, for it will not only enable
her to make wholesome sweets for the family when
desired, but also to prepare a dainty box when
she wishes to make an inexpensive present.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>NUT CANDY</b></div>

<p>For fine nut candy, have the child first pick
out half a cupful of nut meats. Put on in a
small saucepan two level cupfuls of light-brown
sugar, one-half cupful of water, a level teaspoonful
of butter and a tablespoonful of vinegar,
and boil without stirring until the candy crackles
when dropped in cold water. Pour into a well-buttered
pie-pan that has been sprinkled with
the nuts, and as soon as cool, mark into squares.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">
<a href="images/img137-big.jpg"><img src="images/img137.jpg" width="397" height="600" alt="Home-Made Chocolate Creams and Fudge" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Home-Made Chocolate Creams and Fudge</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MAPLE FUDGE</b></div>

<p>For delicious maple fudge, take one and one-half
cupfuls of light-brown sugar, one cupful of
maple sirup, half a cupful of milk, and a level
teaspoonful of butter. Boil slowly until it makes
a soft ball when rolled between the fingers in
cold water, then set aside until cool. Then beat
with a fork until a creamy, sugary mass, turn
quickly on to a buttered plate and mark into
squares. If the little cook finds it is soft from
having been taken off a moment too soon, she
will have to let it stand longer to turn to sugar,
but the fudge that stands overnight will be particularly
smooth.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CREAM CANDY</b></div>

<p>Cream candy is made by boiling two cupfuls
of granulated sugar, <i>without stirring</i>, with three-fourths
cupful water, two tablespoonfuls vinegar
and a teaspoonful of butter until brittle when
dropped in cold water. Pour on to a buttered
pan, but do not scrape the sugared edge of the
kettle, and pull as soon as cool. If a little care
is exercised in handling at first, it will not stick
to the fingers. The butter or flour sometimes
put on the hands to prevent this only spoils the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
candy. When pulled perfectly white, cut with
scissors into small cubes. The longer this stands,
the more delicious it becomes, and if flavored with
a few drops of essence of peppermint when first
put on (so it can be well stirred through) and
then put away when done in a glass jar for a
couple of weeks, it will make delicate "after-dinner
mint."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHOCOLATE CREAMS</b></div>

<p>Easy chocolate creams require two cupfuls of
confectioner's sugar, with a few teaspoonfuls of
milk to moisten enough to work like dough, and
a quarter teaspoonful of vanilla. Knead well,
and work out into small balls. Melt one square
of unsweetened chocolate by first grating and
then setting in a pan of hot water, and drop
in the creams, one at a time. Roll around
quickly with a fork, and lift on to a sheet of buttered
paper. Put in a cool place to harden. Different
flavorings can be used instead of all vanilla,
and half an English walnut stuck on the top of
each cream before the chocolate hardens will add
to the attractiveness. Or, instead of dipping
all the creams in the chocolate, they can be cut
in half and wrapped around with figs or seeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dates. They will grow more creamy if allowed
to stand a day or two.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FUDGE</b></div>

<p>Particularly smooth fudge is made in a way
that seems strange until you try it. Take two
cups of sugar, half a cup of milk, one tablespoonful
of butter, a few drops of vanilla, and
four tablespoonfuls of cocoa. Mix, and boil
without stirring until it makes a soft ball when
dropped in cold water. Remove from the fire,
set aside until cool, then pour on to a buttered
platter and beat with a silver fork until creamy.
When you see it beginning to harden, quickly
smooth out and mark in squares.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MOLASSES TAFFY</b></div>

<p>All little children like this, and it is easily
made. To two cups of molasses, add one cup
of sugar, two tablespoons of butter, and boil until
brittle when dropped in cold water. Add
then one-fourth teaspoonful of soda, stir through
and pour on buttered tins. When cool enough
to handle pull to a light color, cut in sticks, and
lay on oiled paper to harden. This is good
flavored with a few drops of peppermint, but
do not get in too much.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>STUFFED DATES</b></div>

<p>Stuffed dates are a most wholesome sweet, and
quickly made, too. The dates must first be
picked apart, washed in warm water and dried
in an old napkin. Remove the seed from each
with a sharp knife, slip a nut in its place, press
together, and sift over with granulated sugar.
Leave standing a while on oiled paper to become
firm. They are nice served at the end of a dinner,
with the dessert and coffee.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SALTED NUTS</b></div>

<p>Salted nuts, used so much, are usually placed
on the table when it is set, and passed during the
meal. They are very expensive if bought ready
for use, but quite inexpensive made at home.
Either almonds or peanuts can be used, but the
almonds must first be dropped in boiling water
long enough to loosen the skins, which will slip
off easily in a cloth. Melt half a teaspoonful
of butter in a pie-pan, pour in a cup of nut
meats, stir enough to cover with the oil, and
brown in the oven. Remove, and rub dry with
a soft cloth, and sprinkle with fine salt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Preserving</div>


<p>I should not feel the series of lessons complete
without a word to the mothers about how to interest
their girls in this important part of cooking.
It is so easily done, and my own little
daughters took such pleasure in the work, that
I hope every woman will let her child try putting
up at least one kind of fruit. The first
step, however, is to get the fruit jars and glasses
all conveniently at hand, clean and dry, with
fresh rubbers for the tops.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>
<img src="images/img143.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="Marking the Preserves" title="" />
<span class="caption">Marking the Preserves</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CANNED PEARS AND PEACHES</b></div>

<p>Peaches and pears should be thinly peeled and
halved, then dropped into a thick sirup made by
boiling four parts granulated sugar to one part
water. The fruit juice will thin this considerably,
but the fruit should be boiled gently until
thoroughly cooked and transparent. Then lift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
it carefully into the jars, set in a pan of boiling
water, out of a draft, to avoid breaking, pack
to the top, and fill to overflowing with the sirup.
Screw tops on immediately as tight as possible.
This is the great secret of successful canning.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PRESERVED PLUMS</b></div>

<p>Damson plums make a rich, old-fashioned preserve
if washed, pricked, and allowed to stand a
few hours, mixed with an equal quantity of sugar&mdash;pound
for pound&mdash;then put on the stove where
they will gently simmer until cooked down quite
thick. They must be watched carefully, however,
to prevent scorching. Such rich fruit is
best put up in pint jars, as usually only a small
quantity is needed at a time.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CANNED CHERRIES</b></div>

<p>Seed the cherries after washing them, watching
carefully to see that none are wormy, and measure.
Take half the quantity of sugar, moisten with
just enough water to melt, boil to a thick syrup,
and then add the cherries. Cook fifteen minutes,
and seal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>RASPBERRY JAM</b></div>

<p>Pick over the berries, measure, wash and then
crush. Put on to boil, and cook ten minutes, stirring
to keep from sticking to the pan. Then add
three-quarters the amount of heated sugar, cook
twenty minutes longer and pour into small jars,
or in glasses that can be covered with paraffin
as soon as the jam is cold.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BAR-LE-DUC CURRANTS</b></div>

<p>Wash, stem, and measure the currants. Take
three-quarters the amount of sugar, moisten with
barely enough water to melt, boil to a thick syrup,
turn in the currants, and cook twenty minutes.
Pour into small glasses, and as soon as cool cut
rounds of white paper to fit tops, wet in brandy,
and lay over the fruit. Cut larger circles of the
paper, wet thoroughly on one side with white of
egg, and paste over the glass carefully, to make
air-tight. This sounds like going back to the
days of our grandmothers, but these currants
are too rich to be put up in larger quantities,
and jelly tumblers do not have tight tops.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>APPLE JELLY</b></div>

<p>First peel and core sound sour apples, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
put on to stew with just enough water to cover.
Cook until the apples are almost a mush, put in
a jelly-bag, and let hang overnight. Do not
squeeze. Next day measure the juice and let
boil twenty minutes, skimming whenever necessary.
While it is cooking, heat an equal quantity
of granulated sugar in the oven and stir it
in. Cook five minutes longer, or until the jelly
forms when dropped on a cold saucer. Stand
jelly glasses in a dripping-pan, surround with
boiling water, pour in the jelly, and set aside
until firm. When solid, if covered with one-quarter
inch of melted paraffin, it will not mould, nor
will tin covers be necessary.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CRAB APPLE JELLY</b></div>

<p>Crab apple jelly is made in the same way as
the apple jelly, but the fruit is simply wiped off
and quartered,&mdash;not peeled.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GRAPE JELLY</b></div>

<p>Pick grapes from the stem, wash, crush, and
boil twenty minutes. Then put in jelly-bag to
drip overnight, but do not squeeze. Next day
measure juice, boil ten minutes, add an equal
amount of sugar that has been warming, boil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
three minutes, or until a drop jellies on a cold
dish, then turn into glasses.</p>

<p>About half as much juice as drips will be left
in the bag, and it can afterward be squeezed out
and boiled separately, (for it will be cloudy), or
the entire contents of the jelly-bag can be put
through the colander, sweetened and spiced to
taste, and cooked until of the desired thickness.
This makes a nice marmalade.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRUIT COMBINATION</b></div>

<p>At a time when other fruits are very high,
the plain apple jelly, so delicate in flavor itself,
can be mixed when ready to pour with any kind
of preserved fruit, ready to be put up, even in
the proportion of one-fourth, and it will not be
noticeable. Since the pure food law went into
effect and manufacturers have had to print their
formulas on the bottles, we have been able to
gather a few trade secrets; and one of our best-known
firms has this admission on its jam labels:</p>

<p>"These goods are compounded from forty per
cent, each fresh fruit and granulated sugar, with
addition of ten per cent. each fresh apple juice
and corn sirup, to prevent crystallization."</p>

<p>Their jams are very good, but why pay twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
cents a pound for a mixture of apple juice and
corn sirup?</p>

<p>And only forty per cent. fresh fruit!</p>

<p>Really, though, this fine apple jelly is quite
a valuable addition to such strong fruits as
quinces, or such watery ones as strawberries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Sandwiches and Drinks</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SANDWICHES OF CHICKEN OR MEAT</b></div>

<p>For picnics, school luncheons, and her evening
parties my little maid will want sandwiches, and
there are many kinds easily made. And generally
she will want the bread cut very thin and spread
with soft butter. For ordinary occasions she may
use any kind of meat she happens to find in the
house, slicing it if she can, then seasoning with
mustard, or else putting it through the grinder
and seasoning with mustard, a small minced pickle,
or finely chopped sweet green pepper. In using
the ground meat, however, rub it to a paste with
the butter intended for the bread, and it will
spread more easily.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>HAM SANDWICHES</b></div>

<p>To be particularly nice, mince the ham, cream
with the butter, season with mustard, spread on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
one slice of bread, cover with a crisp lettuce leaf,
add the top slice of bread, then cut in triangles.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LETTUCE SANDWICHES</b></div>

<p>On thin slices of buttered bread lay a fresh leaf
of lettuce, and spread with salad dressing, before
adding top slice.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>OLIVE AND CHEESE SANDWICHES</b></div>

<p>These are especially good for afternoon tea or
parties. Butter the bread each time before slicing,
so it can be cut very thin without breaking.
Spread with cream cheese that has been rubbed to
a paste with cream, and sprinkle with chopped
olives. Cut in fancy shapes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>RAISIN SANDWICHES</b></div>

<p>Spread thinly sliced brown bread with butter
first, then with raisins, seeded and chopped.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CRACKER SANDWICHES</b></div>

<p>Butter graham crackers, and spread with
chopped and mixed nuts and raisins. Or, take
square soda crackers, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and toast a light brown. The latter,
served hot, are also very nice for afternoon tea.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Though children should not be allowed to
drink tea and coffee, (and young people are better
off without them,) every little maid should
be taught how to prepare these drinks for the
grown-ups, most of whom are apt to be critical.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>TEA</b></div>

<p>First, find out the kind your friends like if
you possibly can, and do not give Ceylon to a
lover of uncolored Japan! Then have fresh
boiling water, and scald out your teapot, which
should be earthenware or china. While it is still
hot, put in the tea, a teaspoonful for each cup
if you use the ordinary kinds, but only half a
teaspoonful of some of the strong black varieties.
Pour on immediately the required amount of boiling
water, and set in a warm place, or cover with
a cozy for five minutes. If desired cold, then
pour off the grounds, and when cool enough, put
in the ice box or serve at once with chopped ice.
Never boil tea, nor allow to stand on the leaves
very long, as it draws out the injurious tannin,
besides impairing the flavor. A thin slice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
lemon in each glass improves the taste as well
as the looks.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COFFEE</b></div>

<p>People have different ways of making coffee,
but a very easy one is to measure out a tablespoonful
of ground coffee for each cup desired,
tie up in a square cheesecloth, and cover with
an equal number of cups of boiling water.
Set on the stove where it will keep just below
the boiling point, for three minutes, then pour
and serve with cream and sugar. But to make
this way, grind very fine. If your friends prefer
boiled coffee, however, measure out a tablespoonful
for each person, moisten well with part
of the white of an egg, cover with one cup of
cold water, and when that boils, add rest of the
required amount from your boiling teakettle.
Cook for five minutes, then settle with a third of
a cup of cold water, and place where it will not
boil up again. This will make one cupful apiece.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COCOA</b></div>

<p>Cool drinks are most welcomed in hot weather,
and several kinds are quite nice for little girls
to make. Iced cocoa requires for each person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
half a glass of milk and half a glass of water,
heated to the boiling point. Mix in a cup a
round teaspoonful of cocoa with one round spoonful
of sugar, and dissolve with the hot milk.
Then put together in the kettle, boil gently several
minutes, and flavor with a drop or two of
vanilla before taking from the fire. After cooling,
place on ice, and when ready to serve, pour
in glasses over ice, and cover the top with sweetened
whipped cream. Delicious hot, however.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GRAPE JUICE</b></div>

<p>Grape-juice is the most nourishing kind of a
fruit drink, and every family ought to put up
enough in the fall when grapes are plentiful and
cheap to last all winter. First pick the fruit
from the stem, wash and put on in water enough
to cover. Cook until the grapes lose their form,
put in a jelly-bag, and let them hang overnight.
Next day measure, and put on to boil with half
as much sugar. Cook for five minutes and put
at once into air-tight bottles. When ready to
serve, either dilute with a small quantity of water
or pour on chopped ice.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LEMONADE</b></div>

<p>A most refreshing beverage on a very warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
day is a lemonade made from the juice of two
lemons, a half cupful of sugar and eight glasses
of water, to which is added the pulp of a small
grapefruit that has been removed with a sharp-edged
teaspoon. Fill up glasses with shaved ice.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRUIT SYRUPS</b></div>

<p>During the canning season often a small quantity
of rich juice will be left. If this is strained
through a cloth and bottled boiling hot, it will
make a splendid drink, diluted with water and
served iced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A Few More Desserts</div>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Marshmallow Cream</span>
</div>

<p>Before closing, let us consider some simple
every day desserts that every little cook should
know how to make. And first comes</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BREAD PUDDING</b></div>

<p>For a small family, take a quart baking dish,
cover the bottom with broken bread, sprinkle with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
raisins or currants, dot with tiny lumps of butter,
and then repeat the process. Over this second
layer pour a custard made by beating very
light two eggs, adding two cups of milk, a pinch
of salt, half a cupful of sugar, and a little grated
nutmeg. Bake until a light brown on top, and
serve with cream and sugar.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>BROWN BETTY</b></div>

<p>Butter thin slices of bread, line the bottom of
the pudding dish, add a layer of sliced apples,
sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and repeat
these layers until the dish is full. Cover with a
tin lid and bake twenty minutes, then remove lid
and leave until brown on top. The cover is necessary
to keep in the moisture, as the juice of
the apples is the only liquid. Serve with cream
and sugar, or hot sauce.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>COTTAGE PUDDING</b></div>

<p>Cream one-third of a cup of butter with three-fourths
of a cup of sugar, add one egg, beaten
very light, one cup of milk, and two cups of
flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder.
Stir thoroughly and bake in a shallow pan.
Cut in squares and serve hot, with hot chocolate
or lemon sauce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LEMON SAUCE</b></div>

<p>Make a syrup by boiling for five minutes one
cup of sugar with one-quarter cup of water and
a teaspoonful of butter. Removing from the
fire, add the strained juice of half a lemon.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRUIT BATTER PUDDING</b></div>

<p>Take one cup of flour, half a teaspoonful of
salt, and one-half teaspoonful baking-powder,
sifted well, half a cupful of sugar, and stir to a
smooth batter with half cup of milk. Add one
tablespoonful of melted butter, and two eggs,
beaten light, then pour into a buttered pudding
dish over two cupfuls of fresh fruit, either berries,
sliced apples, bananas or peaches, and bake
slowly half an hour. Serve immediately with hot
pudding sauce, flavored with nutmeg.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SPONGE CAKE</b></div>

<p>Beat very light the yolks of three eggs, add
one cup of sugar, half a cup of cold water, one
and one-half cups of flour sifted several times
with two scant teaspoonfuls of baking powder,
flavor with half a teaspoonful of lemon extract,
and lastly fold in the stiff whites. Bake in a
sheet from thirty to forty minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/img159-big.jpg"><img src="images/img159.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="Charlotte Russe" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Charlotte Russe</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>CHARLOTTE RUSSE</b></div>

<p>Cut sponge cake into narrow strips, or use
lady fingers, to line a glass bowl or individual
glass cups as preferred. Fill center with
whipped cream, for which directions are given
elsewhere, and garnish top with Maraschino cherries.
Prepare at the last moment before dinner,
as the cake is apt to become soaked if left
standing long.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MARSHMALLOW CREAM</b></div>

<p>Whip thick half a pint of cream, add two tablespoonfuls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of confectioner's sugar, one white of
egg, beaten stiff, one-quarter of a pound of
marsh-mallows cut in small pieces, two tablespoonfuls
of chopped nuts, and half a teaspoonful
of vanilla. Mix up lightly, and pile on the
split halves of little cakes baked in heart-shaped
pans. Place a Maraschino cherry in the center
of each, pierce with a candy arrow, and pour
a thickened cherry syrup around for a sauce.
This dessert might also be called Bleeding Hearts.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>APPLE DUMPLINGS</b></div>

<p>Sift two cups of flour with two teaspoonfuls
of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt,
work into it two tablespoonfuls of lard until
"mealy," add one cup of milk, and stir with a
fork as little as possible to make a smooth dough.
Turn out on a floured board, roll out thin, cut
in squares, place in the center of each half of
a sour apple, sprinkle with a little sugar and
ground cinnamon, cover with the dough, place
in a pie pan and bake slowly half an hour. Serve
with cream and sugar or hot sauce as preferred.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE INDIVIDUAL</b></div>

<p>Make crust as directed for apple dumplings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
turn on to a floured board, cut out with a biscuit
cutter and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven.
On removing, break each biscuit in half, butter,
place the lower piece in a saucer, cover with
sweetened crushed berries, put on the top half,
and pour the crushed berries over all. Or, if
preferred for a nice company dessert, drop a
big spoonful of whipped cream on top of each
biscuit, and stick a fine whole berry in the center.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>PRUNE WHIP</b></div>

<p>Soak half a pound of prunes over night, then
stew half an hour and sweeten with half a cupful
of sugar. When cool, cut in small pieces or put
through the colander, and stir in to the stiffly
beaten whites of five eggs, with half a cupful of
granulated sugar. Pour into a buttered pudding
dish, bake half an hour in a slow oven, and
serve at once, before it begins to go down, with
thick cream.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>LEMON PIE</b></div>

<p>Make paste as directed before, line a deep
pie pan, prick the bottom to keep from blistering,
and bake in a hot oven about ten minutes.
Remove and fill immediately with the following
preparations:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with one
cup of sugar, add two-thirds of a cup of boiling
water, and one teaspoonful of butter, and cook
five minutes, stirring all the time. Then pour
on to the beaten yolks of two eggs, flavor with
the strained juice and grated rind of one lemon,
and fill the shell. Bake until the crust is brown,
then cover with the meringue, and set back long
enough to color lightly.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MERINGUE</b></div>

<p>Beat two whites very stiff, stir in slowly half
a cupful of powdered sugar, and spread on with
a knife or apply through a pastry tube. It will
take some time to stir in the sugar slowly
enough, but it must be well mixed, then baked
until a delicate brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>APPLE PIE</b></div>

<p>Line a pie tin with the crust, fill with sliced
sour apples, sprinkle thickly with sugar, flavor
with nutmeg, cover with the crust, making an
opening in the center to emit the steam, press
closely together and trim around the edge, and
bake in a moderate oven about three-quarters of
an hour.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
